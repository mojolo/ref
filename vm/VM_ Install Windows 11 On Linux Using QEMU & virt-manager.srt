1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
one of our friends would you like to

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,519
test windows 11

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,679
since it has just been released and yes

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,359
you don't have a spare machine like me

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,439
don't worry i'm going to show you how to

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:15,359
run a fully functional windows 11

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:18,480
on a virtual machine on linux using qemu

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,198
and kvm yes so the reason why i'm

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,439
showing this

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,560
is because i went to the internet and i

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,399
checked on youtube

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,239
and google and everybody is talking

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,640
about windows 11 but nobody

14
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,000
shows how to run it on a virtual machine

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
so i thought i might

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
well as do it and make a video about it

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,558
and so the guy

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
you guys can play and test it like me so

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,238
the first things we need

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,359
uh build of windows 11 that is two one

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,199
nine nine six

22
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,000
and the second thing is what i owe

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,920
intent okay to get what i owe intent

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
we need to go to this link i'll put a

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
link at description i put a link in the

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
description and once you land here

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,360
the safest bet is just to go to the

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
latest word io

29
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,039
and why we are using this because we are

30
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,399
going if you go to archive

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,400
then you can see from 2015

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,760
till 2021 we have we have released the

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,118
drivers forward io

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
this will be used for qemu kvm so if you

35
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,959
click on the link

36
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,118
we have to download this iso the word

37
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,000
iowin019190

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,799
which is the latest one it's 497 max in

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,239
size

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,080
just download it i have already

41
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,000
downloaded previously so these are the

42
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,319
only two files that you require all

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,959
right and i assume you have a functional

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,758
qamu installation on your linux box all

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,280
right

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,239
so to start off we have to fire up a

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,799
word manager

48
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,000
virtual virtual machine manager that is

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,560
qmu virtual

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,399
machine manager and it will load up and

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,280
as you can see i already have a mac os

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
vm if you don't know i am running bixer

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
on this machine too

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
i'll put a link in the description so

55
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,799
you can see how i did it all right

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,479
right now i'm going to install windows

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,040
11 so click on new

58
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,478
file new virtual machine and once this

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,600
loads up we need to

60
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,879
look select local install media and

61
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:10,318
find the iso so choose iso or cd-rom

62
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,079
click on browse and once if this open

63
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,280
click on browse local

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,599
i wish i can speak today and select the

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
windows iso that you have downloaded

66
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,280
all right so it automatically detects

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,719
windows 10 don't worry guys it's

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,640
windows 11 i mean i don't know why it

69
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,719
detects windows windows 10

70
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,079
that is qmu still detects it as windows

71
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,400
and click on forward

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,840
memory i don't have much memory so i can

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
allocate it for gigs

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
safely you can allocate more if you want

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,719
and cpu can allocate more

76
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,598
and storage is see 40 i just have 31.7

77
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,800
gigs left

78
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,039
on this linux partition so i

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,879
cannot give that much i will have to

80
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,280
even go lesser than 40 so

81
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,079
on the safe side i will go 25 don't

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,360
scream at me

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,959
if you have space give hundred i mean if

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
i had space i would give 100

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,920
gb but i don't have space on this day so

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,239
i'm going to be safe side with 25

87
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,079
uh i would select hundreds so select 100

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
if you guys have space but right now i

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,400
don't have space so i'm going to select

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,719
25

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
and i just allocated two cores of my cpu

92
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,158
because i have only four cores so if you

93
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,039
have like 16 cores allocate it

94
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,239
all right so click on forward and this

95
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,840
is the final step

96
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,480
so we need to rename it windows 11

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,439
and windows 11 and qmu that is how i

98
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,158
rename it

99
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,519
so choose your name and storage you see

100
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,399
this is a dynamic storage

101
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
it will not allocate 25 gigs all at once

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,039
um

103
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,039
that's good and please remember to

104
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,639
select customize configuration before

105
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,479
and install because we need to do some

106
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,119
customization network selection looks

107
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,318
fine

108
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,480
click on finish once we click on finish

109
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,598
this is the screen that loads up and i'm

110
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,598
going to walk you through

111
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,839
each of these one by one not each of

112
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,798
these but most majority of these

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,158
and yes i forgot before we need to do

114
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,400
before we need to check on the

115
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,280
preferences and make sure you have

116
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,158
enabled xml editing checked on your

117
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,239
virtual

118
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,519
world manager all right so let me close

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,360
that

120
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
because we'll be modifying xml with our

121
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
hand so all right

122
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,479
all right so this looks good okay so

123
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,438
coming down

124
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,560
we have firmware you can we you see we

125
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,159
have bias

126
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,199
if you want a bias formula that's okay

127
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,000
but i am going to change the firmware to

128
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,919
uefi the newer ones and each time you

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
make a change please remember to click

130
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,959
on apply

131
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,960
all right so i've applied it looks good

132
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,239
nothing to change here os information

133
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,879
looks fine

134
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,120
okay cpus yes this is the place this is

135
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,120
why we enabled xml editing okay

136
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,160
so you see i have four cpu scores i'm

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
allocating two

138
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
you want if you can't want you can

139
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
change the topology this is probably for

140
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,959
a later video not

141
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
the beginner one like this so click on

142
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,439
the xml and this is what we need to

143
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,839
change

144
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,918
come down here and select this clock

145
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,599
offset local time select these two lines

146
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,399
and hit on delete

147
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
and then come to this part where it says

148
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,638
edge pet

149
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,120
please present yes just say yes and not

150
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,478
no click on apply and why we did this

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,639
because it will improve

152
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,000
our cpu performance in a virtual machine

153
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
memory you can change

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,199
it i'm going to keep it at four gigs all

155
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
right suits

156
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
words choose whatever suits you sata

157
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,360
disk okay now the virtual disk bus

158
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,119
that is sata we are going to change it

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,800
to what i o that is why we

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,959
downloaded the word i o drivers from

161
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,280
fedora people because what io has a

162
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,879
better performance than stata all right

163
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,719
that is why i mean i'm gonna give you a

164
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,360
very functional machine with the minimum

165
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
resources

166
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,759
okay click on apply sata cd rom is the

167
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,400
windows 11

168
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,080
nic card okay again device model this is

169
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,279
network source is fine again change it

170
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,439
to what i o

171
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,879
why asking me because again it will give

172
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,959
you better network performance i'm going

173
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,478
to prove it to you just

174
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,918
okay so okay otherwise than that if your

175
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,959
video q qxl

176
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,839
qxl is fine if you you can also select

177
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,120
word i o

178
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,879
it gives you a little bit of 3d

179
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,038
acceleration i don't know if

180
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,319
i'm going to get it because i have my

181
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,120
legacy machine

182
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,600
machine so i'm going to keep it to qxl

183
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
uh

184
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,759
next storage okay that's all i think

185
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
we need to add one more hardware which

186
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,680
is

187
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,439
uh a cd or cd-rom

188
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,478

will install the network drivers and the

197
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
disk drivers because we have selected

198
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,519
what i o for a network driver and a data

199
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,279
bus

00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,240
remember okay this bus is not sata this

201
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,478
bus is

202
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,598
so let's start off so i'm going to

203
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:56,000
minimize

204
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:57,519
close all of this on my system because

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
i have a very light system i want to

206
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,198
make it as lighter as possible

207
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,960
very weak system i should say not a

208
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,639
light system okay so click on begin

209
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,959
installation now

210
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
uh it will take some time to allocate

211
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,799
the disk space

212
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,639
and it will create the domain and yes it

213
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,598
will connect to graphical console for

214
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,400
guest

215
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,639
and we will start okay so it says press

216
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,879
any key to boot from cd or dvd and

217
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,879
we have pressed it and now i'm gonna

218
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,240
walk you through the steps but i'm

219
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,319
through the magic of video editing i'm

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,519
gonna cut down on the time

221
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,960
but remember it will please be patient

222
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,399
it will take at least 40 minutes i don't

223
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,519
know it took me

224
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,478
uh it took me around 45 to 50 minutes i

225
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,879
assume you

226
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,399
it will take you 40 minutes so please

227
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,918
bear with

228
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,279
the installation and don't think it's

229
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,519
going to go as fast as i've shown you on

230
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,198
the video so this is the first step

231
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,680
looks familiar if you have installed

232
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,800
windows 10 so click on next

233
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,519
uh language you you click on install now

234
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,918
and then setup is starting the some

235
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,918
steps are very familiar but some steps

236
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,918
uh they just have a new ui i mean

237
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,839
uh so i'm just gonna walk you through

238
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,959
the entire experience this is like the

239
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,119
full walkthrough

240
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,198
of what will happen when you install

241
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,598
windows 11 on qmu so

242
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,879
uh don't i don't have a product key

243
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,199
click on that no worries

244
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,680
our installation will go down fine in

245
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,280
this screen select windows 11 pro

246
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,240
should be good enough to test and

247
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,839
click on next and it will hopefully

248
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
start the installation okay you have to

249
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,360
read the agreement very carefully and

250
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,440
accept all things that microsoft says

251
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,560
click on custom install and see we don't

252
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,640
have any disks

253
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,158
because what i o drivers are not total

254
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,360
so we have to select

255
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,000
word word load driver and just click on

256
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,159
ok

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
and this will load up all the drivers

258
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,719
from the word io iso file remember

259
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
and since we are installing windows 11

260
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
which is a

261
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
cousin of windows 10 so select windows

262
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,399
10 and click on next

263
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,279
so after the drivers have been loaded

264
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,559
hopefully

265
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,759
we will be seeing the 25 gigs disk that

266
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,759
we allocated

267
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,679
why now this driver will be able to

268
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,000
write and read to the disk

269
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,359
virtual disk that we have selected great

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,919
it has detected so

271
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,759
just blindly hit click on next not

272
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,159
linearly i mean click on next

273
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,679
all right so this will start up the

274
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,399
normal windows installation

275
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,479
and we are going to watch the entire

276
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,278
process so it will it will restart

277
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,720
and it will restart twice so you don't

278
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,480
have to click on restart now you can

279
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,879
click on restart and i was

280
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,240
i didn't click on windows it restart now

281
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,360
so it doesn't matter okay so it's

282
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,320
restarts

283
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,278
and it will the the installation will

284
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
continue

285
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,360
i know for some guys this part is going

286
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
to be boring so if please fast forward

287
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
to

288
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
