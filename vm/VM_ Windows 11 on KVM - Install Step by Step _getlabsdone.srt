00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:04,620
hi welcome to this video in this video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,500
we're going to take a look at how you

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,780
can install Windows 11 on KVM step by

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,759
step so if you wanted to follow step by

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,259
step instruction on my website you can

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,580
do that I will put the link in the

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,199
description

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,960
so before you begin there are some

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,600
prerequisites though uh first thing uh

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,760
you need to have Windows 11 iOS image

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,380
downloaded from the website so I'll put

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,539
the link in the description so that you

13
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,640
can go ahead and download that and you

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,520
need to have the windows 11 water driver

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,859
for KVM so you can also click here to

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,739
download that as well finally you need

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:40,979
to have KVM packages installed on your

18
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:43,619
Linux machine so depending on version of

19
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:46,140
the Linux machine that you are using you

20
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,238
can just enter the command what I have

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,120
shown here and it will let you install

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,959
the KVM packages on your machine so I'm

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,640
using Ubuntu on my laptop right now so I

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,859
just have to copy this entire command

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,079
and just paste it on my terminal so let

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,359
me copy that and open a terminal and

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,439
just right click and paste it and hit

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,680
enter

29
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,478
and enter the password for my account

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,100
and that's it then you see it's zero

31
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,260
upgraded which means I have already

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,298
installed it so I don't need to do

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,180
anything so if you don't have it

34
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,460
installed you might have to install it

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,320
and then proceed with the next step I

36
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,239
already downloaded the files in the

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,819
download directory so for example the

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,739
word i o drivers and the windows 11 ISO

39
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,559
file so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

40
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:34,259
move that files to the KVM directory

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,019
which is located in War live word images

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,938
as you can see I typed LS and you can

43
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,459
see the files both the files that I have

44
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,978
and I'm gonna move that files to move

45
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,199
the file let me switch the directory CD

46
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,438
home safe downloads

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,899
and to move the file you can type MV

48
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:56,039
for more hyphen T and the destination

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,659
which is War live word images and the

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,240
two files that I have in this location

51
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,520
so just copy and paste that it will take

52
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,978
some time for to copy these files to the

53
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,140
destination once done you may proceed

54
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,580
with the windows 11 installation so

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,639
there are two ways you can install a

56
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,980
Windows 11 on KVM you can use CLI based

57
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,439
or you can use GUI based we are going to

58
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,959
install the windows 11 machine using the

59
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,979
GUI based method okay so for that we

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,739
need to use something called

61
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:25,019
virtualization manager

62
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,539
to open the virtualization manager you

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,480
need to type word hyphen manager a

64
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,699
window would appear and which says

65
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,799
virtual machine manager as you can see I

66
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,539
already have an Ubuntu machine in it so

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,660
to create a brand new virtual machine

68
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,219
you may click on the create new VM a new

69
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,799
window would pop up so you have

70
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,719
different choices to make you have local

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,599
installed media Network install Network

72
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,000
boot import existing disk image so if

73
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:54,000
you have qcow 2 image you can use the

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,860
import existing disk image but in my in

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,019
our case it's just a purely a brand new

76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,700
installation with ISO so you can choose

77
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,400
the first option which is local install

78
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,919
media ISO image or CD-ROM and click on

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,900
forward now you need to choose ISO or

80
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,639
CD-ROM for the installation media we

81
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,459
already have it in our location so you

82
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,098
may click on browse and as you can see

83
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,459
by default it took you to the war live

84
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:19,139
word images directory so you just have

85
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,658
to choose the windows 11 image from

86
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:24,839
there by default it would automatically

87
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:28,199
pick up the windows 10 as a operating

88
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,939
system however if you like you can

89
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,399
uncheck the option and manually select

90
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,318
the operating system but at the time of

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
this recording Windows 11 is not there

92
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,859
in the list better you keep the Windows

93
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,598
10 itself

94
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,720
and click on forward

95
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:45,479
and you need to configure memory and CPU

96
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,340
four gigs would be fine and two CPUs

97
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,340
should be fine as well but I'm gonna

98
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,959
give maybe eight gigs of RAM and the CPU

99
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,378
I'm gonna give for as you can see I have

100
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,360
12 CPUs so I can give four and you can

101
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:00,179
also install the windows 11 without any

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,099
issues with just two CPUs click on

103
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,719
forward and I'm going to create a

104
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,539
virtual hard disk for the windows 11

105
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,419
machine right so this I'm Gonna Keep it

106
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,039
like 40 gigs that is enough for me if

107
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,378
you have more storage you may increase

108
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:17,399
it depending on your need and once you

109
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:20,219
have done that you may click on forward

110
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,500
so here I need to name the VM it has

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,960
picked up the windows 10 as a VM name so

112
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,180
I'm gonna change it to Windows 11.

113
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,439
and after that I have to click the

114
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,720
option which says customize

115
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,459
configuration before install and if you

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
expand the network selection you can see

117
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:38,459
by default it has picked up Nat which is

118
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,680
good for us and click on finish

119
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,899
as we have chosen customized

120
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,819
configuration before install we got a

121
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,439
window where you can customize a lot of

122
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,418
the configuration that we're gonna use

123
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,060
for the operating system so the first

124
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:54,240
things first overview we're gonna enable

125
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,000
secure boot here in my previous video I

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,340
have shown you how you can enable a

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,139
secure Boot and TPM on KVM so you need

128
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,779
to do that first which is already

129
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,000
mentioned in my blog article so you may

130
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,099
follow that and come back here and

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,100
continue with this change the chipset to

132
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,100
i44tfx

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,680
and the last option in the list and

134
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,220
click on apply and you need to add the

135
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,379
TPM so click on ADD hardware and in the

136
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,699
add new virtual Hardware window choose

137
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,860
DPM in that model choose tis

138
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:32,220
and click on finish and you can see the

139
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,020
TPM version 2.0 has been added next we

140
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,900
are going to configure the CPU even

141
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:39,359
though we have allocated for CPU the

142
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:42,239
Windows machine is not gonna recognize

143
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,460
that so select the CPU under topology

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,918
check the option which says manually set

145
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:50,698
CPU topology so in that sockets change

146
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,620
to one and course 2 threads 2 and in the

147
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,139
current allocation change back to 4 and

148
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,879
click on apply

149
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,720
there is nothing you have to do on the

150
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,418
memory

151
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,080
click on boot options and enable the

152
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:06,000
CD-ROM which is the windows 11 ISO

153
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,038
and just keep it like that so the first

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,779
primary boot device would be the hardest

155
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,699
the world's largest we created and the

156
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,799
second would be Siri ROM so what would

157
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,600
happen is when you boot for the first

158
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,699
time it will try to boot from the hard

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,979
disk and since there is no files in it

160
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,379
it will Skip and move to the windows 11

161
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:25,318
ISO CD-ROM so it will boot from it

162
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,139
install it on the hard disk and once you

163
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,180
reboot the machine then it will boot

164
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,220
from the hard disk because we already

165
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,660
moved the files from the CD-ROM to the

166
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,740
hard disk you keep the settings like

167
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,419
this and click on apply next uh the

168
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,840
virtual hard disk that we created we

169
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:46,079
need to change that from SATA to word IO

170
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,119
click on apply and we already added the

171
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,219
windows 11 ISO image so we also need to

172
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,220
add another ISO image which is a vertio

173
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,580
KVM driver so to do that click on ADD

174
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,699
hardware and in that choose storage and

175
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:02,399
click on manage and then this time

176
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,978
choose whether your driver under device

177
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,258
type change that to Siri ROM device and

178
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:08,818
click on finish when we begin the

179
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,660
installation we have chosen the network

180
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,520
interface as Nat which is good but you

181
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,100
need to change that from device model to

182
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,978
word IO in order for it to work properly

183
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,699
and click on apply next you need to also

184
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:26,818
add a VNC driver click on ADD R Hardware

185
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,400
and click on Graphics from there type

186
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,419
choose VNC server and click on finish

187
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:35,818
and you may click on begin installation

188
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,918
so press any key to boot from it so make

189
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,520
sure you press any key so it will boot

190
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,519
from the CD

191
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,519
choose the language of your choice time

192
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,199
keyboard and then click on next and then

193
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,560
install now

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,240
the setup would now load

195
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,038
um since I don't have a product key I

196
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,900
can choose I don't have a product key at

197
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,000
the moment and also if you have product

198
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,679
key it is not gonna work because there

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,478
is no internet connectivity for the host

200
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,759
which we'll have to fix it at the end of

201
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,038
the installation so for now just choose

202
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,720
I don't have a product key so you will

203
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,939
be getting the versions of Windows that

204
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,120
you're gonna install so I'm gonna choose

205
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:20,279
Windows 11 Pro and click on next accept

206
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,899
the license agreement and then click on

207
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,000
next

208
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,239
which type of installation do you want

209
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,918
choose custom install Windows only

210
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,620
so where is the virtual hard disk we

211
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,899
don't see any right that's because

212
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,700
there's no driver for it to detect we're

213
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,620
gonna click on load driver and click on

214
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,020
OK because we attach the word or your

215
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,479
driver as a CD ROM it will detect that

216
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,000
so choose Windows 11 from it and then

217
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,379
click on next after few seconds you will

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,940
see the virtual hard disk on the

219
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,820
installation screens

220
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,060
so as you can see there's a drive zero

221
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,680
an allocated space so choose that and

222
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,500
then click on next

223
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,778
and the installation just now begin and

224
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,179
you can see the copying file started now

225
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:05,338
so this process would take some time so

226
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,259
you need to have some patience let me

227
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,360
fast forward this

228
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,120
during the installation it is expected

229
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,240
that the windows will you know reboot

230
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,778
couple of times so just wait for it to

231
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,778
come back up

232
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,639
just a moment

233
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,479
the windows logo just appeared and in

234
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,159
this choose the line you know the

235
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,680
country or region that you would like

236
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,419
keyboard language of your choice

237
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,159
I don't want to add any extra keyboard

238
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:39,719
and I'm gonna choose I don't have an

239
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,000
internet connection

240
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,060
and I'm gonna continue with the limited

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,240
setup if you are using latest version of

242
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:50,879
Windows 11 ISO image you most likely

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,700
won't get I don't have internet option

244
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,100
so what will you do for example this is

245
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,100
my another installation setup with the

246
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,800
latest Windows 11 ISO image in it at the

247
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,080
moment I do not see any option that says

248
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,899
I don't have internet connection and

249
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,060
many users will stuck here and here is a

250
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,480
workaround for that while you are on the

251
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:14,579
screen press shift F10 you might have to

252
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,759
use function key as well for it to work

253
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,259
you'll get a command prompt here you

254
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:26,580
need to enter the command o o b e

255
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:28,799
backslash bypass nro and hit enter the

256
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,320
system would now reboot and after it's

257
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,199
come back up you will have to start over

258
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,600
again with the windows 11 initial setup

259
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,540
wizard eventually on the let's connect

260
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,519
you to the network screen you now get an

261
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,219
option that says I don't have internet

262
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,679
click on that and continue with the

263
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,480
limited setup the one more benefit of

264
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,819
not having the internet connectivity is

265
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,060
that you can create your local account

266
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,740
so continue with the limited setup and

267
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,419
then it will ask you to set up the

268
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,060
username and password and things like

269
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:02,539
that so under the you know username that

270
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,539
you're going to use

271
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,440
and then next and come come from the

272
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,540
password and then next it will ask you

273
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,180
three security questions so you may

274
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,740
answer them and then click on next uh so

275
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:17,159
in the privacy settings you choose

276
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,259
whatever you like almost there

277
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,600
this is the desktop and you don't see

278
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,458
some of the logos because we don't have

279
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,540
internet connectivity yet on the machine

280
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:30,599
so we're gonna fix that right now

281
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,759
if I click on display settings

282
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,399
I don't see any options to add just

283
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,139
screen size because there is no driver

284
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,480
for it which we're gonna fix it right

285
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,639
now so click on the start menu and go to

286
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,519
computer management a window would

287
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,620
appear and choose device manager and as

288
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,379
you can see there are some drivers which

289
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,778
is not present on the operating systems

290
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,519
so first uh we are going to fix a

291
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,439
network adapter ethernet controller

292
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,060
under other devices so right click on

293
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,399
the ethernet controller click on update

294
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,379
driver and browse my computer for

295
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,620
drivers

296
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:08,179
and attach some CD drive that we have

297
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,179
added with the word IO

298
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,958
and it will search for the drivers for

299
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,879
the ethernet adapter as you can see it

300
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,699
has picked up the red advert IO ethernet

301
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,320
adapter so which which is good so after

302
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,860
that click on close

303
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,420
and then let's head on to PCI device so

304
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,519
right click on that and do the same

305
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:28,799
procedure like what we did for the

306
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,860
network adapter and it will also install

307
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,599
the drivers close this

308
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,159
we're gonna do it for the last drivers

309
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,839
as well there's one more thing that we

310
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,879
need to do which is the display adapter

311
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,800
that we need to install or upgrade right

312
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,778
so we already have Microsoft you know

313
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,759
generic adapter so we're going to update

314
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:47,338
that as well right click on that basic

315
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,078
adapter update it and just like we did

316
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,120
for the other drivers just do it as well

317
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,819
all right and if you go to the display

318
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,740
settings you will see I now have the

319
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,899
options to adjust the display resolution

320
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,220
which is good so I can just keep the

321
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,500
changes

322
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,839
okay which is good you can also see the

323
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,220
internet connection is back online next

324
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,860
thing what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go

325
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,720
to open up the edge since I'm opening

326
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,759
the edge for the first time I'm getting

327
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,620
some welcome screen from the Microsoft

328
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,879
the main important part is to understand

329
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,560
whether I can access the internet

330
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,980
download right so

331
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,199
I can open my website just fine and

332
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,200
that's it we have just installed the

333
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,019
windows 11 on KVM and you can open the

334
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,579
RDP and start using it thanks for

335
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,879
watching and I'll see you guys on the

336
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,879
next one
