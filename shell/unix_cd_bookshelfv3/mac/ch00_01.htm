<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1><p>Once upon a time, Unix came with only a few standard utilities, and
if you were lucky, it included a C compiler. When setting up a new
Unix system, you'd have to crawl the Net looking for
important software: Perl, <em class="filename">gcc</em>,
<em class="filename">bison</em>, <em class="filename">flex</em>,
<em class="filename">less</em>, Emacs, and other utilities and languages.
That was a lot of software to download through a 28.8 kbps modem.
These days, Unix distributions come with much more, and it seems like
more and more users are gaining access to a wide-open pipe.
</p><p>Free Linux distributions pack most of the GNU tools onto a CD-ROM,
and now commercial Unix systems are catching up. IRIX includes a big
selection of GNU utilities, Solaris comes with a companion CD of free
software, and just about every flavor of Unix (including Mac OS X)
now includes Perl. Mac OS X comes with many tools, most of which are
open source and complement the tools associated with Unix.
</p><p>This book serves as a bridge for Unix developers and system
administrators who've been lured to Mac OS X because
of its Unix roots. When you first launch the Terminal application,
you'll find yourself at home in a Unix shell, but
like Apple's credo--"Think
Different"--you'll soon find
yourself doing things a little differently. Some of the standard Unix
utilities you've grown accustomed to may not be
there, <em class="filename">/etc/passwd </em>and<em class="filename"> /etc/group
</em>have been supplanted with something called NetInfo, and
when it comes to developing applications, you'll
find that things like library linking and compiling have a few new
twists to them.
</p><p>Despite all the beauty of Mac OS X's Aqua interface,
you'll find that a few things are different on the
Unix side. But rest assured, they're easy to deal
with if you know what to do. This book is your survival guide for
taming the Unix side of Mac OS X.

<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />0.1. Audience for This Book</h2>

<p>This book is aimed at Unix developers, a category that includes
programmers who switched to Linux from a non-Unix platform, web
developers who spend most of their time in
<em class="filename">~/public_html</em> over an <em class="filename">ssh</em>
connection, and experienced Unix hackers. In catering to such a broad
audience, we chose to include some material that advanced users might
consider basic. However, this choice makes the book accessible to all
Unix programmers who switch to Mac OS X as their operating system of
choice, whether they have been using Unix for one year or ten. If you
are coming to Mac OS X with no Unix background, we suggest that you
start with <a name="IXT-0-32" /><em class="emphasis">Learning
Unix for Mac OS X</em> (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, Inc.) to get up to speed with the very basics.
