Once you log in, you can use the many facilities that Unix provides.
As an authorized system user, you have an account that gives you:
</p><ul>

<li>
<p>
A place in the Unix filesystem where you can store your
files.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A username that identifies you, lets you control
access to your files, and is an address for your email.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
An environment you can customize.

<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />3.1. The Unix Filesystem</h2>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279715" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-287" />
A <em class="emphasis">file</em> is the unit of storage in Unix, as in most
other systems.
A file can hold anything: text (a report you're writing, a to-do list),
a program, digitally encoded pictures or sound, and so on.
All of those are just sequences of raw data until they're interpreted
by the right program.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279716" />
In Unix, files are organized into directories.
A <em class="emphasis">directory</em> is actually a special kind of file where
the system stores information about other files.
You can think of a directory as a place, so that files are said to be
contained <em class="emphasis">in</em> directories and you are said to work
<em class="emphasis">inside</em> a directory.
(If you've used a Macintosh or Microsoft Windows computer,
a Unix directory is similar to a folder.)
</p>

<p>
This section introduces the Unix filesystem.
Later sections in this chapter show how you can look in files and
protect them.
<a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4</a> has more information.
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.1. Your Home Directory</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279717" />
<a name="IXT-3-279718" />
When you log in to Unix, you're placed in
a directory called your <em class="emphasis">home directory</em>.
This directory, a unique place in the Unix filesystem, contains
the files you use almost every time you log in.
In your home directory, you can make your own files.
As you'll see in a minute, you can also store your own directories
within your home directory.
Like folders in a file cabinet, this is a good way to organize your
files.
</p>
</div>




<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.2. Your Working Directory</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279719" />
<a name="IXT-3-279720" />
<a name="IXT-3-279721" />
<a name="IXT-3-279722" />
Your <em class="emphasis">working directory</em> (also called your
current directory) is the directory you're currently working in.
Every time you log in, your home directory is your working directory.
You may change to another directory, in which case the directory you
move to becomes your working directory.
</p>

<p>
Unless you tell Unix otherwise, all commands that you enter apply
to the files in your working directory.
In the same way, when you create files, they're created in your working
directory unless you specify another directory.
For instance, if you type the command
<tt class="literal">pico</tt> <b class="emphasis-bold">report</b>, the
Pico editor is started on a file named <em class="emphasis">report</em> in your working
directory.
But if you type a command such as 
<tt class="literal">pico</tt> <b class="emphasis-bold">/home/joan/report</b>,
a <em class="emphasis">report</em> file is edited in a different directory--without
changing your working directory.
You'll learn more about this when we cover pathnames later in this chapter.
</p>

<p>
If you have more than one terminal window open, or you're logged
in on several terminals at the same time, each session has its
own working directory.
Changing the working directory in one session doesn't affect
others.

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.3. The Directory Tree</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279723" />
<a name="IXT-3-279724" />
<a name="IXT-3-279725" />
All directories on a Unix system are organized into a hierarchical structure
that you can imagine as a family tree.
The parent directory of the tree (the directory that contains all
other directories) is known as the
<em class="emphasis">root directory</em>
<a name="IXT-3-279726" />


<a name="IXT-3-279727" />



<a name="IXT-3-279728" />

and is written as a forward slash (<tt class="literal">/</tt>).
</p>

<p>
The root contains several directories.
<a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-1">Figure 3-1</a>
shows a visual representation of the top of a Unix filesystem
tree: the root
directory and some directories under the root.
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0301.gif" alt="Figure 3-1" width="391" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-1. Example of a directory tree</h4>

<a name="IXT-3-279734" />


<em class="emphasis">bin</em>, <em class="emphasis">etc</em>,
<em class="emphasis">users</em>, <em class="emphasis">tmp</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">usr</em> are some of the <em class="emphasis">subdirectories</em>
(child directories) of the root directory.
These subdirectories are fairly standard directories;
they usually contain specific kinds
of system files.
For instance, <em class="emphasis">bin</em> contains many Unix programs.
Not all systems have a directory named <em class="emphasis">users</em>.
It may be called <em class="emphasis">u</em> or <em class="emphasis">home</em>,
and/or it may be located in some other part of the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
In our example, the parent directory of <em class="emphasis">users</em>
(one level above) is the root directory.
It has two subdirectories (one level below),
<em class="emphasis">john</em> and <em class="emphasis">carol</em>.
On a Unix system, each directory has only one parent directory, but it may have
one or more subdirectories.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a>
A subdirectory (such as <em class="emphasis">carol</em>) can have its own
subdirectories (such as <em class="emphasis">work</em> and <em class="emphasis">play</em>),
up to a limitless depth for practical purposes.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p> [7]
On most Unix systems, the root
directory, at the top of the tree, is <em class="emphasis">its own</em> parent.
Some systems have another directory above the root.

<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-308" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-309" />
To specify a file or directory location, write its
<em class="emphasis">pathname</em>.
A pathname is like the address of the directory
or file in the Unix filesystem.
We look at pathnames in a moment.
</p>

<p>
On a basic Unix system, all files in the filesystem are stored on
disks connected to your computer.
It isn't always easy to use the files on someone else's computer or for
someone on another computer to use your files.
<a name="IXT-3-279735" />
<a name="IXT-3-279736" />
Your system may have an easier way: a <em class="emphasis">networked
filesystem</em>.
Networked filesystems make a remote computer's files appear as if they're
part of your computer's directory tree.
For instance, a computer in Los Angeles might have a directory
named <em class="emphasis">boston</em> with some of the
directory tree from a company's computer in Boston.
Or individual users' home directories may come from various computers,
but all be available on your computer as if they were local files.
The system staff can help you understand and configure your computer's
filesystems to make your work easier.

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-1.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.4. Absolute Pathnames</h3>

<p>
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-312" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-313" />
As you saw earlier, the Unix filesystem organizes its files and directories
in an inverted tree structure with the root directory at the top.
An <em class="emphasis">absolute pathname</em> tells you the path of
directories you must travel to get from the root to the directory or
file you want.
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-314" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-315" />
In a pathname, put slashes (<tt class="literal">/</tt>) between the
directory names.
</p>

<p>
For example, <em class="emphasis">/users/john</em> is an absolute pathname.
It locates one (<em class="emphasis">only</em> one!) directory.
Here's how:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
The root is the first "/"
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The directory <em class="emphasis">users</em> (a subdirectory
of <em class="emphasis">root</em>)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The directory <em class="emphasis">john</em> (a subdirectory
of <em class="emphasis">users</em>)
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Be sure that you do not type spaces anywhere in the pathname.
<a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-2">Figure 3-2</a> shows this structure.
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0302.gif" alt="Figure 3-2" width="420" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-2. Absolute path of directory john</h4>


<p>
In
<a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-2">Figure 3-2</a>,
you'll see that the directory
<em class="emphasis">john</em> has a subdirectory named <em class="emphasis">work</em>.
Its absolute pathname is <em class="emphasis">/users/john/work</em>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279737" />
<a name="IXT-3-279738" />
The root is always indicated by the slash (/) at the start of the pathname.
In other words,
<em class="emphasis">an absolute pathname always starts with a slash</em>.

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-1.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.5. Relative Pathnames</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279739" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-321" />
You can also locate a file or directory with a
<em class="emphasis">relative pathname</em>.
A relative pathname gives the location relative to your working
directory.
</p>

<p>
Unless you use an absolute pathname (starting with a slash), Unix
assumes that you're using a relative pathname.
Like absolute pathnames, relative pathnames can go through more than
one directory level by naming the directories along the path.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you're currently in the <em class="emphasis">users</em> 
directory (see <a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-2">Figure 3-2</a>),
the relative pathname to the <em class="emphasis">carol</em> directory below
is simply <em class="emphasis">carol</em>.
The relative pathname to the <em class="emphasis">play</em> directory below
that is <em class="emphasis">carol/play</em>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that neither pathname in the previous paragraph
starts with a slash.
That's what makes them relative pathnames!
Relative pathnames start at the working directory, not the root directory.
In other words,
<em class="emphasis">a relative pathname never starts with a slash</em>.
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-1.5.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.1.5.1. Pathname puzzle</h3>

<p>
Here's a short but important question.
The previous example explains the relative pathname
<em class="emphasis">carol/play</em>.
What do you think Unix would say about the pathname
<em class="emphasis">/carol/play</em>? 
(Look again at <a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-2">Figure 3-2</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Unix would say "No such file or directory."
Why?
(Please think about that before you read more.
It's very important and it's one of the most common beginner's mistakes.)
Here's the answer.
Because it starts with a slash, the pathname
<em class="emphasis">/carol/play</em> is an absolute pathname that starts
from the root.
It says to look in the root directory for a
subdirectory named <em class="emphasis">carol</em>.
But there is no subdirectory named <em class="emphasis">carol</em> one level
directly below the root, so the pathname is wrong.
The only absolute pathname to the <em class="emphasis">play</em>
directory is <em class="emphasis">/users/carol/play</em>.
</p>
</div>


<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-1.5.2" /><div class="sect3">

<a name="IXT-3-279741" />
<a name="IXT-3-279742" />
<a name="IXT-3-279743" />


You can go up the tree with the shorthand ".." (dot dot) for the
parent directory.
As you saw earlier, you can also go down the tree by using subdirectory names.
In either case (up or down), separate each level by a slash (/).
</p>

<p><a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-3">Figure 3-3</a> shows part of <a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-1">Figure 3-1</a>.
If your working directory in the figure is <em class="emphasis">work</em>,
then there are two pathnames for the <em class="emphasis">play</em> subdirectory of
<em class="emphasis">carol</em>.
You already know how to write the absolute pathname,
<em class="emphasis">/users/carol/play</em>.
You can also go up one level (with "..")
to <em class="emphasis">carol</em>, then go down the tree to 
<em class="emphasis">play</em>.
<a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-3">Figure 3-3</a> illustrates this.
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0303.gif" alt="Figure 3-3" width="299" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-3. Relative pathname from work to play</h4>

<p>The relative pathname would be <em class="emphasis">../play</em>.
It would be wrong to give the relative address as
<em class="emphasis">carol/play</em>.
Using <em class="emphasis">carol/play</em> would say that
<em class="emphasis">carol</em> is a subdirectory of your
working directory instead of what it is in this case--the parent directory.
</p>

<p>
Absolute and relative pathnames are totally interchangeable.
Unix programs simply follow whatever path you specify to wherever it leads.
If you use an absolute pathname, the path starts from the root.
If you use a relative pathname, the path starts from your working directory.
Choose whichever is easier at the moment.

<a name="IXT-3-279744" />

Once you know the absolute or relative pathname of a directory where
you'd like to work, you can move up and down the Unix directory tree

To find which directory you're currently in, use
<b class="emphasis-bold">pwd</b> (print working directory).
The <b class="emphasis-bold">pwd</b> command takes no arguments.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>pwd</b></tt>
/users/john
$

</p>

<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">pwd</b> prints the absolute pathname

<h3 class="sect3">3.1.6.2. cd</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279748" />

<a name="IXT-3-279749" />
You can change your working directory to any directory (including
another user's directory--if you have permission) with the <b class="emphasis-bold">cd</b> (change directory) command.
</p>

<p>The <b class="emphasis-bold">cd</b> command has the form:
</p>


<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">cd</b> <em class="emphasis">pathname</em>
</p>


<p>
The argument is an absolute or a relative pathname (whichever is
easier) for the directory you want to change to:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /users/carol</b></tt>
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>pwd</b></tt>
/users/carol
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>cd work</b></tt>
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>pwd</b></tt>
/users/carol/work
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> 

Here's a timesaver: the command
<b class="emphasis-bold">cd</b>, with no arguments, takes you to
your home directory from wherever you are in the filesystem.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that you can only change to another directory.
You cannot <b class="emphasis-bold">cd</b> to a filename.
If you try, your shell (in this example, <b class="emphasis-bold">bash</b>)
gives you an error message:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /etc/passwd</b></tt>

A directory can hold subdirectories.
And, of course, a directory can hold files.
<a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-4">Figure 3-4</a> is a close-up of the filesystem around
<em class="emphasis">john</em>'s home directory.
The four files are shown along with the <em class="emphasis">work</em>
subdirectory.

<p>
Pathnames to files are made the same way as pathnames to directories.
As with directories, files' pathnames can be absolute (starting from
the root directory) or relative (starting from the working directory).
For example, if your working directory is <em class="emphasis">users</em>,
the relative pathname to the <em class="emphasis">work</em> directory below
would be <em class="emphasis">john/work</em>.
The relative pathname to the <em class="emphasis">ch1</em> file would be
<em class="emphasis">john/ch1</em>.
</p>

<p>
Unix filesystems can hold things that aren't directories or files,
such as symbolic links, FIFOs, and sockets
(they have pathnames, too).
You may see some of them as you explore the filesystem.
We don't cover those advanced topics in this little book.

<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-344" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-345" />


To use the <b class="emphasis-bold">cd</b> command, you must decide
which entries in a directory are subdirectories and which are files.
The <b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> command lists entries in the
directory tree and can also show you which is which.
</p>

<p>
When you enter the <b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> command, you'll
get a listing of the files and subdirectories contained in your
working directory.
The syntax is:
</p>


<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> <em class="emphasis">option(s) directory-and-filename(s)</em>
</p>


<p>
If you've just logged in for the first time, entering
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> without any
arguments may seem to do nothing.
This isn't surprising because you haven't made any files in your
working directory.
If you have no files, nothing is displayed; you'll simply get a new
shell prompt:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>ls</b></tt>
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
But if you've already made some files or directories in your account,
those names are displayed.
The output depends on what's in your directory.
The screen should look something like this:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>ls</b></tt>
ch1    ch10    ch2    ch3   intro
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
(Some systems display filenames in a single column.
If yours does, you can make a multicolumn display with the
<b class="emphasis-bold">-C</b> [uppercase "C"] option or the
<b class="emphasis-bold">-x</b> option.)
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> has a lot of options that change the
information and display format.
</p>

<p>The <b class="emphasis-bold">-a</b> option (for
<em class="emphasis">all</em>) is guaranteed to show you some
more files, as in the following example showing a directory like
the one in <a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-4">Figure 3-4</a>:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>ls -a</b></tt>
.      .exrc      ch1     ch2     intro
..     .profile   ch10    ch3

<a name="IXT-3-279758" />
When you use <b class="emphasis-bold">ls -a</b>,
you'll always see at least two entries
with the names "." (dot) and ".." (dot dot).
As mentioned earlier, .. is always the relative pathname 
to the parent directory.
A single . always stands for its working directory; this is useful
with commands like <b class="emphasis-bold">cp</b>
(see <a href="ch04_04.htm#lunix5-CHP-4-SECT-4.2">Section 4.4.2</a> in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4</a>).
There may also be other files, such as <em class="emphasis">.profile</em>
or <em class="emphasis">.exrc</em>.
Any entry whose name begins with a dot is hidden--it's listed
only if you use <b class="emphasis-bold">ls -a</b>.
<a name="IXT-3-279759" />
<a name="IXT-3-279760" />
</p>

<p>
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-353" />
To get more information about each item that
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> lists, add the
<b class="emphasis-bold">-l</b> option.
(That's a lowercase "L" for "long.")
This option can be used alone, or in combination with
<b class="emphasis-bold">-a</b>, as shown in
<a href="ch03_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-5">Figure 3-5</a>.
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-3-FIG-5" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0305.gif" alt="Figure 3-5" width="435" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-5. Output from ls -al</h4>

<p>
The long format provides the following information about each
item:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Total n</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-3-279761" />
<a name="IXT-3-279762" />
<em class="emphasis">n</em></tt> amount of storage used by
everything in this directory.
(This is measured in <em class="emphasis">blocks</em></tt>.
On many systems, but not all, a full block holds 1024 bytes.
A block can also be partly full.)
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Type</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-3-279763" />

Tells whether the item is a directory
(<tt class="literal">d</tt>) or a plain file (<tt class="literal">-</tt>).
(There are other less common types that we don't explain
here.)
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Access modes</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>


<a name="IXT-3-279764" />
<a name="IXT-3-279765" />
<a name="IXT-3-279766" />
<a name="IXT-3-279767" />
<a name="IXT-3-279768" />
<a name="IXT-3-279769" />

Specifies three types of users (yourself, your group, all
others) who are allowed to read (<tt class="literal">r</tt>), write
(<tt class="literal">w</tt>), or execute (<tt class="literal">x</tt>)
your files.
We'll say more about this in a moment.
</p></dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Links</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-3-279770" />
The number of files or directories linked to this
one.
(This isn't the same sort of <em class="emphasis">link</em> as in a web page.
We don't discuss filesystem links in this little book.)
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Owner</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>


<a name="IXT-3-279771" />

The user who created or owns this file
or directory.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Group</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

The group that owns the file or directory.
(If your version of Unix doesn't show this column, add the
<b class="emphasis-bold">-g</b> option to see it.)
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Size (in bytes)</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-3-279772" />
The size of the file or directory.
(A directory is actually a special type of file.
Here, the "size" of a directory is of the directory file itself,
not of all the files in that directory.)
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Modification date</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-3-279773" />
When the file was last modified, or the directory
contents last changed (when something in the directory was added, renamed,
or removed).
If an entry was modified more than six months ago,
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> shows the year
instead of the time.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Name</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-3-279774" />
The name of the file or directory.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279775" />
<a name="IXT-3-279776" />
<a name="IXT-3-279777" />
Notice especially the columns that list the owner and group of the
files, and the access modes (also called permissions).
The person who creates a file is its owner; if you've created any files
(or system staff did it for you), this column should show
your username.
You also belong to a group, set by the person who created your account.
Files you create are either marked with the name of your group, or
in some cases, the group that owns the directory.
</p>

<p>

The <em class="emphasis">permissions</em></tt> show who can read,
write, or execute the file or directory; we explain what that means
in a moment.
The permissions have ten characters.
The first character shows the file type (<tt class="literal">d</tt> for directory
or <tt class="literal">-</tt> for a plain file).
The other characters come in groups of three.
The first group, characters 2-4, show the permissions for the
file's owner, which is yourself if you created the file.
The second group, characters 5-7, show permissions for other
members of the file's group.
The third group, characters 8-10, show permissions for all other
users.
</p>

<p>
For example, the permissions for <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> are
<tt class="literal">-rw-r--r--</tt>, so it's a plain file.
The owner, <em class="emphasis">john</em></tt>, has both read and write permissions.
Other users who belong to the file's group <em class="emphasis">doc</em></tt>,
as well as all other users of the system, can only read the file; they don't
have write permission, so they can't change what's in the file.
No one has execute (<tt class="literal">x</tt>) permission, which should only
be used for executable files (files that hold programs).
</p>

<p>
In the case of directories, <tt class="literal">x</tt> means the
permission to access the directory--for example, to run a command
that reads a file there or to use a subdirectory.
Notice that the two directories shown in the example are executable
(accessible) by <em class="emphasis">john</em></tt>, by users in the
<em class="emphasis">doc</em></tt> group, and by everyone else on the system.
A directory with <tt class="literal">w</tt> (write) permission allows
deleting, renaming, or adding files within the directory.
Read (<tt class="literal">r</tt>) permission allows listing the directory
with <b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-279778" />
You can use the <b class="emphasis-bold">chmod</b> command to change
the permissions of your files and directories.
See <a href="ch03_03.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 3.3</a>, later in this chapter.
</p>

<p>
If you need to know only which files are directories and which
are executable files, you can use the <b class="emphasis-bold">-F</b>
option.
</p>

<p>

<a name="IXT-3-279779" />
<a name="IXT-3-279780" />


If you give the pathname to a directory,
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> lists the directory
but it does <em class="emphasis">not</em></tt> change your working directory.
The <b class="emphasis-bold">pwd</b> command in the following
example shows this:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>ls -F /users/andy</b></tt>
calendar    goals    ideas/
ch2         guide/   testpgm*
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>pwd</b></tt>
/etc
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>

<a name="IXT-3-279781" />
<a name="IXT-3-279782" />



<b class="emphasis-bold">ls -F</b> puts a / (slash) at the end
of each directory name.
(The directory name doesn't really have a slash in it; that's just the
shortcut <b class="emphasis-bold">ls -F</b> uses to identify a directory.)
In our example, <em class="emphasis">guide</em></tt> and <em class="emphasis">ideas</em></tt>
are directories.
You can verify this by using <b class="emphasis-bold">ls -l</b>
and noting the "d" in the first field of the output.
Files with an execute status (<tt class="literal">x</tt>), such as programs,
are marked with an <tt class="literal">*</tt> (asterisk).
The file <em class="emphasis">testpgm</em></tt> is an executable file.
Files that aren't marked are not executable.
<a name="IXT-3-279783" />
<a name="IXT-3-279784" />
<a name="IXT-3-279785" />



</p>

<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls -R</b> ("recursive")
lists a directory and all its subdirectories.
This can make a very long list--especially when you list a
directory near the root!
(Piping the output of <b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> to a pager
program solves this problem.
There's an example in <a href="ch05_02.htm#lunix5-CHP-5-SECT-2.3">Section 5.2.3</a>
in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5</a>.)
You can combine other options with <b class="emphasis-bold">-R</b>:
for instance, <b class="emphasis-bold">ls -RF</b> marks
each directory and file type.
</p>

<p>
On Linux and other systems with the GNU version of
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b>, you may be able to see names in
color. 
For instance, directories could be green and program files could be
yellow.
Like almost everything on Unix, of course, this is configurable.
The details are more than we can cover in an introductory book.
Try typing <b class="emphasis-bold">ls --color</b>
and see what happens.
(It's time for our familiar mantra: check your documentation.
See <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8</a>--especially the
<b class="emphasis-bold">man</b> command for reading a command's
online manual page.)
