<h2 class="sect1">6.6. Usenet News</h2>

<p>

<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-751" />
<a name="IXT-6-279996" />

Usenet, also called "Net News," has thousands of worldwide discussion groups.
Each discussion is carried on as a series of messages in its own
<em class="emphasis">newsgroup</em>.
A newsgroup is named for the kind of discussion that happens there.
Each message is a lot like an email message.
But, instead of
being sent to a list of email addresses, a newsgroup message is sent to all
the computers that subscribe to that particular newsgroup--and
any user with access to that computer can read and reply to the message.
</p>

<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> 

Because Usenet is a public forum, you'll find a variety of people
with a variety of opinions--some impolite, rude, or worse.
Although most users are friendly and helpful, a few people seem to
cause most of the problems.
Until you're accustomed to Usenet, be aware that you may be offended.
</p>

To read Usenet groups, you'll need a <em class="emphasis">newsreader</em>
program, also called a <em class="emphasis">news client</em>.
Many email programs can read news, too.
You can use any newsreader; the principles of all are about the same.
Some of the more popular Unix newsreaders are
<b class="emphasis-bold">slrn</b>,
<b class="emphasis-bold">nn</b>, and
<b class="emphasis-bold">trn</b>.
We show how to read news with Pine Version 4.33.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-22">[22]</a>
If you haven't used Pine before, please read <a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.3">Section 6.5.3</a>, earlier in this chapter.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-22" /><p> [22]
Much older versions of Pine can't show newsgroups.
Choose another newsreader or upgrade to the newest Pine.
</p>

If your system's copy of Pine has been set up to read Usenet messages,
when you choose the <span class="keycap">L</span> key ("folder list") from the main menu,
you'll get a Collection List screen like
<a href="ch06_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-9">Figure 6-9</a>.
A <em class="emphasis">collection</em> is a group of folders.
A collection can be email folders from your local computer,
email folders from other computers, or Usenet newsgroup folders.
<a href="ch06_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-9">Figure 6-9</a> shows two collections:
<em class="emphasis">Mail</em> and <em class="emphasis">News on news/nntp</em>.
The News collection is selected (highlighted).
</p>

<p>
If your copy of Pine is recent enough to read Usenet, but doesn't seem to
do it, check the configuration settings, as described in
<a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.5">Section 6.5.5</a>, earlier in this chapter.
The <em class="emphasis">collectionList</em> settings can set up a collection
of folders for news.
You may also need to set the <em class="emphasis">nntp-server</em> hostname
to the computer which serves news articles; your system staff should
be able to tell you the right hostname.
</p>

<p>
When you press
<span class="keycap">ENTER</span> or
<span class="keycap">&gt;</span> to view that collection,
you'll get a list of newsgroup folders that's probably huge.
Usenet has something for everyone!
The Pine 
<span class="keycap">D</span> command will delete a newsgroup
from your list; it won't appear anymore unless you use the
<span class="keycap">A</span> command to add it back.
(Pine also has some advanced features, like "zooming" to a list of
folders that you've defined.
See the Pine help system for details.)
<a href="ch06_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-10">Figure 6-10</a> shows a list of some newsgroups.
</p>


<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-10" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0610.gif" alt="Figure 6-10" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-10. Pine newsgroup collection list screen</h4>

<p>
Newsgroup names are in a hierarchy, with names of the levels separated
by dots (.):
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The main hierarchies include <em class="emphasis">comp</em> (for discussions
about computers);
organization, city, regional and national groups (such as <em class="emphasis">ne</em> for New England, <em class="emphasis">uk</em>
for the United Kingdom, and so on);
<em class="emphasis">misc</em> ("miscellaneous");
and so on.
The <em class="emphasis">alt</em> ("alternative") hierarchy is for
almost anything that doesn't fit in the others.
</p></li>

<li><p>
All the top levels have subcategories, or second-level categories.
For instance, the <em class="emphasis">alt</em> category has subcategories
<em class="emphasis">alt.3d</em>, <em class="emphasis">alt.activism</em>,
<em class="emphasis">alt.adoption</em>, and so on, as you can see in
<a href="ch06_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-10">Figure 6-10</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A second-level category may have third-level categories.
For instance, the category <em class="emphasis">alt.animals</em> is divided into
<em class="emphasis">alt.animals.badgers</em>,
<em class="emphasis">alt.animals.bears</em>,
and so on.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> 

When you first start to read Usenet, it's a good idea to spend a
couple of hours exploring what's available and what you're interested
in--and deleting unwanted newsgroups from your list.
The time you spend at first will pay you back later, by letting you go
straight to the newsgroups in which you're interested.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
People all over the world frequent particular newsgroups.
Just as mail folders have email messages, newsgroups have
<em class="emphasis">news articles</em> (individual messages posted by
someone).
These messages <em class="emphasis">expire</em> after a period of time.
(That's part of why a lot of newsgroups appear empty.)
Let's look into a newsgroup.
Go to the newsgroup <em class="emphasis">news.announce.newusers</em>;
scroll through the folder list by pressing
the space bar, or if in a hurry, use the
<span class="keycap">W</span> ("whereis") command and enter the newsgroup name.
Once you've selected the name from
the collection list, press
<span class="keycap">ENTER</span> or
<span class="keycap">&gt;</span> to view it.
You'll see a list of messages in the group, as in
<a href="ch06_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-11">Figure 6-11</a>.
</p>


<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-11" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0611.gif" alt="Figure 6-11" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-11. Pine newsgroup message index screen</h4>

<p>
<a name="IXT-6-280000" />
<a name="IXT-6-280001" />
Read Usenet messages just as you read email messages;
for example, select a message from the message index and press
<span class="keycap">ENTER</span> or
<span class="keycap">&gt;</span> to view it.
It stays in the index until it's deleted
or expires.
Deleting messages you've read or don't want to see makes it easier
to find new messages that come in later.
To keep a message, save a copy to a Pine mail folder with the
<span class="keycap">S</span> ("save") command,
email a copy to other users with the
<span class="keycap">F</span> ("forward") command,
or save a copy to a file with the
<span class="keycap">E</span> ("export") command.
</p>




<blockquote><b>WARNING:</b> 

Remember that people worldwide will see your message and have your email
address.
If your message is insulting, long and rambling, includes a lot
of the original message unnecessarily, or just makes people unhappy,
you're likely to get a lot of email about it.
Many newsgroups have periodic FAQ ("frequently asked questions") postings
that give more information about the group and answer common questions.
We suggest that you not post messages to newsgroups until you've read
Usenet for a while, have learned what style is acceptable, and have
seen enough of the discussion in a particular group to know whether your
question or comment has been discussed recently.
</p>
<p>
Also, remember that spammers (people who send "junk email" with
advertising and worse) will be able to see the email address on
your Usenet posting.
For that reason, many people set a different email address in the
"From:" field when posting Usenet messages.
If your Internet provider gives you multiple email addresses, you
could choose one just for your Usenet postings.
(Readers may want to reply to your message by email, though, so
consider using an email address that you do read occasionally.
You also can include your "real" address in the body of the article,
possibly disguised to fool spammers who search Usenet articles for
email addresses.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If there's a message you want to reply to, the Pine
<span class="keycap">R</span> command starts a reply.
After asking whether to include a copy of the original message in
your reply, Pine asks you: "Follow-up to news group(s), Reply via
email to author or Both?"
If you want all who read this newsgroup to see your reply, choose
<span class="keycap">F</span> to follow up; your reply, including your name and email
address, is posted for everyone to see.
If your message is just for the author--for instance, a question or
a comment--replying by email with
<span class="keycap">R</span> is the better choice.
</p>

<p>
You can post a new message to a newsgroup with the
<span class="keycap">C</span> ("compose") command.
If you're viewing a news folder, Pine asks
if you want to compose a message to that newsgroup.
(If you answer
<span class="keycap">N</span> ("no"), Pine creates a regular email message.)
</p>

<p>
Here's one more tip: to read expired messages or search through years of
archives, web sites like Google Groups
(<a href="http://groups.google.com/">http://groups.google.com/</a>)
allow this.
