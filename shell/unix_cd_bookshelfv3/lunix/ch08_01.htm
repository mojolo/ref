Now that you're almost to the end of this guide, let's look at some
ways to continue learning about Unix.
Documentation is an obvious choice, but it isn't always in obvious places.
You can save time by taking advantage of other shell features--aliases,
functions, and scripts--that let you shorten a repetitive job and
"let the computer do the dirty work."
</p><p>
We'll close by seeing how you can use Unix commands on non-Unix systems.

<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />8.1. Documentation</h2>

<p>
You might want to know the options to the programs we've introduced--and
get more information about them and the many other Unix programs.
You're now ready to consult your system's documentation and other
resources.

<h3 class="sect2">8.1.1. The man Command</h3>

<p>
Different versions of Unix have adapted Unix documentation in
different ways.
Almost all Unix systems have documentation derived from a manual
originally called the <em class="emphasis">Unix Programmer's Manual</em>.
The manual has numbered sections; each section is a collection of manual
pages, often called "manpages"; each program has its own manpage.
Section 1 has manpages for general Unix
programs such as <b class="emphasis-bold">who</b> and
<b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-8-280042" />
<a name="IXT-8-280043" />

Many Unix installations have individual manual pages stored on the
computer; users can read them online.
If your system has online manpages,
and you want to know the correct syntax for entering a command or the
particular features of a program, enter the command
<b class="emphasis-bold">man</b> and the name of the command.
The syntax is:
</p>

<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">man</b> <em class="emphasis">command</em>
</p>


<p>
For example, if you want to find information about the program
<b class="emphasis-bold">mail</b>, which allows you to send
messages to other users, enter:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>man mail</b></tt>
	.
	.
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The output of <b class="emphasis-bold">man</b> may be filtered
through a pager like <b class="emphasis-bold">less</b> automatically.
If it isn't, just pipe the output of <b class="emphasis-bold">man</b>
to <b class="emphasis-bold">less</b> (or
<b class="emphasis-bold">more</b> or
<b class="emphasis-bold">pg</b>).
</p>

<p>
After you enter the command, the screen fills with text. 
Press <span class="keycap">SPACE</span> or <span class="keycap">RETURN</span> to read more,
and <b class="emphasis-bold">q</b> to quit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-8-280044" />
Some systems also have a command called
<b class="emphasis-bold">apropos</b> or
<b class="emphasis-bold">man -k</b> to help you locate a command if
you have an idea of what it does but are not sure of its correct name.
Enter <b class="emphasis-bold">apropos</b> followed by a descriptive
word; you'll get a list of commands that might help.
</p>

<a name="IXT-8-280045" />
</p>

<dl>

<dt><i><b class="emphasis-bold">man</b> <em class="emphasis">says there is no manual entry for the command.</em></tt></i></dt>
<dd>

Some commands--<b class="emphasis-bold">cd</b> and
<b class="emphasis-bold">jobs</b>, for example--aren't separate
Unix programs; they're part of the shell.
On some Unix systems, you'll find documentation for those commands
in the manual page for the shell.
(To find the shell's name, see <a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.3">Section 1.1.3</a>
in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1</a>.)
</p>

<p>
If the program isn't a standard part of your Unix system--that is,
your system staff added the program to your system--there may not
be a manual page, or you may have to configure the
<b class="emphasis-bold">man</b> program to find the local manpage files.

<h3 class="sect2">8.1.2. The info Command</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-8-280046" />
<a name="IXT-8-280047" />
<a name="IXT-8-280048" />
Linux systems, as well as some others, have a program called
<b class="emphasis-bold">info</b>.
It serves the same purpose as <b class="emphasis-bold">man</b>:
to document system programs.
The <b class="emphasis-bold">info</b> output is in a different
format, though.
The syntax to start <b class="emphasis-bold">info</b> is:
</p>


<p><b class="emphasis-bold">info</b> <em class="emphasis">command</em></tt></p>


<p>
For example, if you want to find information about the program
<b class="emphasis-bold">find</b>, which searches for files, enter <b class="emphasis-bold">info find</b>.
After you enter the command,
press <span class="keycap">SPACE</span> to read more or "q" to quit.

<h3 class="sect2">8.1.3. Documentation via the Internet</h3>

<p>
The Internet changes so quickly that any list of online Unix documentation
we'd give you would soon be out of date.
Still, the Internet is a great place to find out about Unix systems.
Remember that there are many different versions of Unix--so some
documentation you find may not be completely right for you.
Also, some information you'll find may be far too technical for your needs
(many computer professionals use and discuss Unix).
But don't be discouraged!
Once you've found a site with the general kind of information you need,
you can probably come back later for more.
</p>

<p>
Many Unix command names are plain English words, which can make
searching hard.
If you're looking for collections of Unix information, try searching
for the Unix program named <b class="emphasis-bold">grep</b>.
As this book went to press, one especially Unix-friendly
search engine was Google, at
<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are some other places to try:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">Magazines</b>, both in print and online-only,
have Unix tutorials and links to more information.
Many are written for beginners.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">Publishers</b>, like O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.
(<a href="http://www.oreilly.com">http://www.oreilly.com</a>),
have areas of their websites that feature Unix and
have articles written by their books' authors.
They may also have books online (such as the O'Reilly Safari service) available
for a small monthly fee--which is a good way to learn a lot quickly
without needing to buy a paper copy of a huge book, most of which you
may not need.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">Vendors' sites</b>
like Red Hat (<a href="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</a>),
and Unix-related organizations
like the Free Software Foundation
(<a href="http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</a>),
usually have documentation and support files online, where you can
search for what you need.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">Universities</b> often use Unix-like
systems and will have online documentation.
You'll probably have better luck at the Computer Services division
(which services the whole campus)
than at the Computer Science department (which may be more technical).
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sect2">8.1.4. Books</h3>

<p>
Bookstores, both traditional and online, are full of computer books.
The books are written for a wide variety of needs and backgrounds.
Unfortunately, many books are rushed to press, written by authors with
minimal Unix experience, full of errors.
Before you buy a book, read through parts of it.
Does the style (brief or lots of detail, chatty and friendly or organized
as a reference) fit your needs?
Search the Internet for reviews; online bookstores may have readers'
comments on file.
