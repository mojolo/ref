<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />0.1. The Unix Family of Operating Systems</h2>

<p>
An <em class="emphasis">operating system</em> (or "OS")
is a set of programs that controls a computer.
It controls both <em class="emphasis">hardware</em> (things you can touch, like
keyboards, screens, and disk drives) and <em class="emphasis">software</em>
(application programs that you run, like a word processor).

Some computers have a <em class="emphasis">single-user</em> OS, which means that only one
person can use the computer at a time.
Many older OSes (such as MS-DOS) can also do only one job at a time.
But almost any computer can do a lot more if it has a
<em class="emphasis">multiuser, multitasking</em> operating system such as Unix.
These powerful OSes let many people use the computer at the same time
and let each user run several jobs at once.
</p>

<p>
Unix was invented more than 30 years ago for scientific and
professional users who wanted a very powerful and flexible OS.
It's been significantly developed since then.
Because Unix was designed for experts, it can be a bit overwhelming at first.
But after you get the basics (from this book!) you'll start to appreciate
some of the reasons to use Unix:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
It comes with a huge number of powerful application programs.
You can get many others for free on the Internet.
(The GNU utilities, available from the Free Software
Foundation, are very popular.)
You can thus do much more at a much
lower cost.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
Not only are the applications often free, but some
Unix versions are also free.
Linux is a good example.
Like the free applications, most free Unix versions are of excellent quality.
They're maintained by volunteer programmers who want a powerful OS and
are frustrated by the slow, bug-ridden OS development at some big
software companies.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
Unlike OSes such as Microsoft Windows and MacOS that are designed for
certain types of hardware, Unix runs on almost any kind,
from tiny embedded systems to giant supercomputers.
After you read this book, you'll be ready to use many kinds
of computers without learning a new OS for each one.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
In general, Unix (especially without a windowing
system) is less resource-intensive than other major operating systems.
For instance, Linux will run happily on an old system with a x386
microprocessor and let multiple users share the same computer.
(Don't bother trying to use the latest versions of Microsoft Windows on a
system that's more than a few years old!)
If you need a windowing system, Unix lets you choose from
modern feature-rich interfaces as well as from simple ones that need much
less system power.
Anyone with limited resources--educational institutions,
organizations in developing countries, and so on--can use Unix to
do more with less.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Much of the Internet's development was done on Unix
systems.
Many Internet web sites and Internet service providers use Unix because
it's so flexible and inexpensive.
With powerful hardware, Unix really shines.
</p>
