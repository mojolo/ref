You may see a notice that says "You have mail"
when you first log in to your system, or later, before a shell prompt.
Someone has sent you a message or document
by <em class="emphasis">electronic mail</em> (email).
With email, you can compose a message at your terminal and send it to
another user or list of users.
You also can read any messages that others may have sent to you.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of email programs for Unix.
If you'll use email often, we recommend that you start with whatever
program other people in your group use.
</p>

<p>
We start with a brief section on addressing email.
Next, you'll see how to send mail from a shell prompt
with Berkeley <b class="emphasis-bold">mail</b>.
Then we introduce sending and reading mail with Pine,
a popular menu-driven program that works without a window system.
If you'd like to try a graphical program (which we won't discuss here),
many web browsers have an email window. All programs' basic principles are the same though, and they all can
send and receive messages from each other.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-19">[19]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-19" /><p> [19]
Microsoft Windows users have an unfortunate habit of sending email
"attachments" made with a Windows-specific program like Microsoft Word.
On Unix systems, you can read these messages using popular word
processing programs such as StarOffice, but it can be a pain.
You might ask Windows users to send plain text
messages, which everyone can read without special software.
</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.1. Addressing an Email Message</h3>

<p>
Most addresses have this syntax:
</p>


<p><em class="emphasis">username@hostname</em></p>


<p>
<a name="IXT-6-279987" />
<a name="IXT-6-279988" />
<em class="emphasis">username</em> is the person's username, like
<em class="emphasis">jerry</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">hostname</em> is either the name of his computer or a
central domain name for his entire organization,
like <em class="emphasis">oreilly.com</em>.
On many Unix systems, if the recipient reads email on the same computer
you do, you may omit the <em class="emphasis">@hostname</em>.
(An easy way to get a copy of a message you send is to add your username
to the list of addressees.)
</p>

</div>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.2. Sending Mail from a Shell Prompt</h3>

<p>
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-734" />
<a name="IXT-6-279989" />
Most Unix systems have a fairly simple program from Berkeley Unix called
<b class="emphasis-bold">Mail</b> (with an uppercase "M"),
<b class="emphasis-bold">mailx</b>, or just
<b class="emphasis-bold">mail</b>.
If you enter just the program name at a shell prompt, you can read
your email, but its terse interface isn't very friendly.
If you enter the program name, followed by addresses as arguments,
you can send an email message.
This is handy for sending a quick message from your keyboard.
But it's best used with redirection (explained in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5</a>)
to email the output of a
program or the contents of a file.
</p>


<p>
To send mail, give the address of each person you want to send a
message to, such as one of the following:
</p>


<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">Mail</b> <em class="emphasis">address1 address2</em> ...
</p>
<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">mailx</b> <em class="emphasis">address1 address2</em> ...
</p>
<p>
<b class="emphasis-bold">mail</b> <em class="emphasis">address1 address2</em> ...
</p>


<blockquote><b>WARNING:</b> 

It's best to use simple addresses such as
<em class="emphasis">username@hostname</em> on the command line.
More complex addresses--with peoples' names or special characters
such as <tt class="literal">&lt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&gt;</tt>--can cause
trouble unless you know how to deal with them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After you enter <b class="emphasis-bold">mail</b> and the
addresses, if you're sending a message from the keyboard,
in most cases the program (depending on how it's set up)
prompts you for the subject of the message.
Many versions of the program also accept a subject as a
command-line argument after the <b class="emphasis-bold">-s</b>
option; be sure to put quote marks around the subject!
Here are two examples of redirection:
first sending the restaurant list you made in an earlier example,
then sorting the list before you send it:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>mail -s "My favorite restaurants" jerry@oreilly.com &lt; food</b></tt>
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>sort food | mail -s "My favorite restaurants" jerry@oreilly.com</b></tt>
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
If you've redirected the standard input from a pipe or file, as in these
two examples, your message will be delivered.
Otherwise, <em class="emphasis">mail</em> will wait for you to enter the
message body.
Type in your message, line by line, pressing <span class="keycap">RETURN</span>
after every line.
When you've finished entering text, type <span class="keycap">CTRL-D</span>
(just once!) at the start of a new line.
You should get the shell prompt at this point, though it
might take a few seconds.</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>mail alicja@moxco.chi.il.us</b></tt>
Subject: <tt class="userinput"><b>My Chicago trip
Alicja, I will be able to attend your meeting.
Please send me the agenda.  Thanks.

Jerry
^D</b></tt>
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>If you change your mind before you type <span class="keycap">CTRL-D</span>,
you can cancel a message (while you're still entering text) with
your interrupt character (see
<a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.8">Section 1.1.8</a> in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1</a>).
The cancelled message may be placed in a file called
<em class="emphasis">dead.letter</em> in your home directory.
To see other commands you can use while sending mail, enter
<b class="emphasis-bold">~?</b> (tilde question mark) at the start
of a line of your message, then press <span class="keycap">RETURN</span>.
To redisplay your message after using <b class="emphasis-bold">~?</b>,
enter <b class="emphasis-bold">~p</b> at the start of a line.
</p>

<p>
You can't cancel a message after you type
<span class="keycap">CTRL-D</span>
(unless you're a system administrator and you're lucky to catch the
message in time).
So, if you change your mind about Alicja's meeting, you'll need to send
her another message.
</p>

<p>
Please try the previous examples, substituting your address for the
sample addresses shown.
Once you've found the correct program name and the email address you
can use to send a message to yourself, write them down.
You'll probably find this is a very useful way to send yourself little
reminder messages, the contents of files, and the outputs of programs:
</p>


<p>___________   Name of email program that sends from a shell prompt</p>

<p>_________________________   My email address</p>

<h3 class="sect2">6.5.3. Reading Email with Pine</h3>

<p>

<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-736" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-737" />

Pine, from the University of Washington, is a popular program for
reading and sending email from a terminal.
It works completely from your keyboard; you don't need a mouse.
Pine isn't a standard part of all Unix systems; if you don't have it,
you can use other email programs.
If you read this introduction but don't have Pine, ask your system
staff to download and install it.
Like most Unix software, Pine is free.
</p>

<p>
Start Pine by entering its name at a
shell prompt.
It also accepts options and arguments on its command line;
to find out more, enter <b class="emphasis-bold">pine -h</b>
("help").
If new email is waiting for you, but you want to experiment with Pine
without taking chances, the <b class="emphasis-bold">-o</b>
(lowercase letter "O") option makes your inbox folder read-only;
you won't be able to change the messages in it until you quit Pine
and restart without the <b class="emphasis-bold">-o</b>.
<a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-5">Figure 6-5</a> shows the starting display,
the <em class="emphasis">main menu</em>.
</p>


<p>
The highlighted line, which is the default command,
gives a list of your email folders.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-20">[20]</a>
You can choose the highlighted command by pressing
<span class="keycap">RETURN</span>, pressing the greater-than sign
<span class="keycap">&gt;</span>, or typing the letter
next to it (here, <b class="emphasis-bold">l</b>, a lowercase
<span class="keycap">L</span>; you don't need to type the commands in uppercase).
But since you probably haven't used Pine before, the only interesting
folder is the inbox, which is the folder where your new messages wait
for you to read them.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-20" /><p> [20]
Recent versions of Pine also let you read Usenet newsgroups.
The <b class="emphasis-bold">L</b> command takes you to another display where you choose the source
of the folders, <em class="emphasis">then</em> you see the list of folders
from that source.
See <a href="ch06_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-6">Section 6.6</a>, later in this chapter.

<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-5" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0605.gif" alt="Figure 6-5" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-5. Pine main menu</h4>

<p>
The bottom of the display in <a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-5">Figure 6-5</a>
shows that there are two messages waiting.
Let's go directly to the inbox by pressing <span class="keycap">I</span>
(or by highlighting that line in the menu and pressing <span class="keycap">RETURN</span>)
to read the new mail.
<a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-6">Figure 6-6</a> has the <em class="emphasis">message index</em>
for Alicja's inbox.
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0606.gif" alt="Figure 6-6" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-6. Pine message index</h4>

<p>
The main part of the window is a list of the messages in the
folder, one message per line.
If a line starts with N, like the second message does, it's a new message
that hasn't been read before.
(The first message has been sitting in the inbox for some time now...)
Next on each line is the <em class="emphasis">message number</em>; messages
in a folder are numbered 1, 2, and so on.
That's followed by the date the message was sent, who sent it,
the number of characters in the message (size), and finally the
message subject.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the display is Pine's reminder list of commands.
When you aren't sure what to do, this is a good place to look.
If you don't see what you want here, pressing <span class="keycap">O</span> 
(the letter "o"; lowercase is fine) shows you more choices.
For more information, <span class="keycap">?</span> gives detailed help.
</p>

<p>
Let's skip this first message and read the next one, number 2.
The down-arrow key or the <span class="keycap">N</span> key moves the highlight
bar over that message.
As usual, you can get the default action--the one shown in brackets
at the bottom of the display
(here, <tt class="literal">[ViewMsg]</tt>)--by pressing
<span class="keycap">RETURN</span> or <span class="keycap">&gt;</span>.
The message from Jerry will appear.
</p>


<p>
Just as <span class="keycap">&gt;</span> took us forward in Pine, the
<span class="keycap">&lt;</span> key
generally takes you back to where you came
from--in this case, the message index.
You can type <span class="keycap">R</span> to reply to this message,
<span class="keycap">F</span> to forward it (send it on to someone else),
<span class="keycap">D</span> to mark it for deletion,
and <span class="keycap">TAB</span> to go to the next message without deleting this one.
</p>

<p>
When you mark a message for deletion, it stays in the folder message index,
marked with a <tt class="literal">D</tt> at the left side of its line,
until you quit Pine.
Type <span class="keycap">Q</span> to quit.
First Pine asks if you really want to quit.
If you've marked messages for deletion, Pine asks if you want to
<em class="emphasis">expunge</em> ("really delete") them.
Answering <span class="keycap">Y</span> here actually deletes the message.
</p>

<p>
There's much more to Pine than we can cover here.
For instance, it lets you organize mail in multiple folders, print,
pipe (output) messages to Unix programs, search for messages, and more.
Recent versions of Pine can access mail folders on other computers using
IMAP; this lets you use Pine (and other email programs) on many
computers, but keep one main set of mail folders on a central computer.

<h3 class="sect2">6.5.4. Sending Email with Pine</h3>

<p>

<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-738" />

If you're sending a quick message from a shell prompt, you may want to
use the method shown in <a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.2">Section 6.5.2</a> earlier in this chapter.
For a more interactive way to send email, try Pine.
We'll take a quick tour.
</p>

<p>
If you've already started Pine, you can compose a message from many
of its displays by typing
<span class="keycap">C</span>.
(Though, as always, not every Pine command is available at every display.)
You can also start from the main menu.
Or, at a shell prompt, you can go straight into message composition by
typing "<b class="emphasis-bold">pine</b>
<em class="emphasis">addr1 addr2</em>", where each
<em class="emphasis">addr</em> is an email address like
<em class="emphasis">jerry@oreilly.com</em>.
In that case, after you've sent the mail message, Pine quits and leaves you at another shell prompt.
</p>

<p>
When you compose a message, Pine puts you in a window called the
<em class="emphasis">composer</em>.
(You'll also go into the composer if you use the Reply or Forward commands
while you're reading another mail message.)
The composer is a lot like the Pico editor, but the first few lines are
special because they're the message <em class="emphasis">header</em>--the "To:",
"Cc:" (courtesy copy), "Attchmnt:" (attached file), and "Subject:" lines.
<a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-7">Figure 6-7</a> shows an example, already filled in.
</p>


<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-7" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/lu5.0607.gif" alt="Figure 6-7" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-7. Pine composer</h4>

<p>
As you fill in the header, the composer works differently than when
you're in the message text (body of the message).
The list of commands at the bottom of the window is a bit different
in those cases, too.
For instance, while you edit the header, you can attach a file to
the end of the message with the "Attach" command, which is
<span class="keycap">CTRL-J</span>. However, when you edit the body, you can
read a file into the place you're currently editing (as opposed to attaching
it) with the <span class="keycap">CTRL-R</span> "Read File" command.
But the main difference between editing the body and the header is
the way you enter addresses.
</p>

<p>
If you have more than one address on the same line, separate them with commas
(<tt class="literal">,</tt>).
Pine will rearrange the addresses so there's just one on each line, as
shown in <a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-7">Figure 6-7</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are several ways to give the composer the addresses where the message
should be sent:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Type the full email address, like <em class="emphasis">jpeek@jpeek.com</em>.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
If you're sending email to someone who uses the same computer you do,
type their username.
Pine will fill in <tt class="literal">@</tt><em class="replaceable"><tt>hostname</tt></em>
as soon as you move the cursor to the next line.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
Type a nickname from the address book.
(See <a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.4.1">Section 6.5.4.1</a>, later in this chapter.)
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Move up and down between the header lines with
<span class="keycap">CTRL-N</span> and <span class="keycap">CTRL-P</span>,
or with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys, just as you would in Pico.
When you move into the message body (under the "Message Text" line),
type any text you want.
Paragraphs are usually separated with single blank lines.
</p>

<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> 

If you put a file in your home directory
named <em class="emphasis">.signature</em>
(the name starts with a dot, "<tt class="literal">.</tt>"),
the composer automatically adds its contents to the end
of every message you compose.
(Some other Unix email programs work the same way.)
You can make this file with a text editor like Pico, or from
the Pine setup menu (see <a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.5">Section 6.5.5</a>, later in this chapter).
It's good Internet etiquette to keep this file short--no more than four or five lines, if possible.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can use familiar Pico commands such as
<span class="keycap">CTRL-J</span> to justify a paragraph and
<span class="keycap">CTRL-T</span> to check your spelling.
When you're done, <span class="keycap">CTRL-X</span> ("exit") leaves the composer,
asking first if you want to send the message you just wrote.
Or <span class="keycap">CTRL-C</span> cancels the message, though you'll be
asked if you're sure.
If you need to quit, but don't want to send or cancel, the
<span class="keycap">CTRL-O</span> command postpones your message;
then, the next time you try to start the composer, Pine asks whether you want to continue the postponed composition.
</p>

The Pine <em class="emphasis">address book</em> can hold peoples' names and

When you compose a message, enter peoples' nicknames in the message header;
Pine replaces that with the full name and address.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-21">[21]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-21" /><p> [21]
Recent versions of Pine also let you store your address book on
a central server, in order for you to access it, from whatever other
computer you're using at the moment, via IMAP.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can enter information by hand from the main menu by choosing
<span class="keycap">A</span> ("address book"), then adding
new entries and editing old ones.
Also, as you read email messages that you've received, the
<span class="keycap">T</span> ("take address") command makes new
address book entries for that message's addressees.
</p>

<p>
<a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-8">Figure 6-8</a> shows the address book entry form.
Edit each line as you would in the composer, then use
<span class="keycap">CTRL-X</span> to save the entry.
The "Fcc" line gives the name of an optional Pine folder;
when you send a message to this address book entry,
Pine puts a copy in this folder.
(If you leave "Fcc" blank, Pine uses the
<em class="emphasis">sent-mail</em> folder.)
All lines except nickname and address are optional.

<a name="lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-5.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.5. Configuring Pine</h3>
<p>
<a name="IXT-6-279992" />

The Pine main menu (shown in <a href="ch06_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-FIG-5">Figure 6-5</a>) has a
Setup entry for configuring Pine.
We assume that your system staff has configured important options,
like your printer command, and we look at a few other settings you might
want to change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="IXT-6-279993" />
<a name="IXT-6-279994" />

After you enter 
<span class="keycap">S</span> (the "Setup" command), you can choose what kind
of setup you want to do.
From the setup screen, you can get to the option configuration area with
<span class="keycap">C</span> (the "Config" command).

</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-6-279995" />

The configuration screen has page after page of options.
You can page through them with the space bar (to move
forward one page), the <span class="keycap">-</span> key (back one page),
the <span class="keycap">N</span> key (to move forward to the next entry), and
the <span class="keycap">P</span> key (back to the previous entry).
If you know the name of an option you want to change, you can search
for it with <span class="keycap">W</span> (the "Whereis" command).
</p>

<p>
When you highlight an option, the menu of commands at the bottom of
the screen will show you what can do with that particular option.
A good choice, while you're exploring, is the
<span class="keycap">?</span> ("Help") command,
to find out about the option you've highlighted.
There are several kinds of options:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Options with variable values:
names of files, hostnames of computers, and so on.
For example, the <em class="emphasis">personal-name</em> option sets the
name used in the "From:" header field of mail messages you send.
The setup entry looks like this:
</p>

<p><blockquote><pre class="code">
personal-name        = &lt;No Value Set: using "Robert L. Stevenson"&gt;
</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>"No Value Set" can mean that Pine is using the default from the
system-wide settings, as it is here.
If this user wants his email to come from "Bob Stevenson," he could
use the <span class="keycap">C</span> ("Change Val") command to set that name.
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
Options that set preferences for various parts of Pine.
For instance, the <em class="emphasis">enable-sigdashes</em> option in the "Composer Preferences" section puts two dashes
and a space on the line before your default signature.
The option line looks like this:
</p>

<p><blockquote><pre class="code">
[X]  enable-sigdashes
</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>
The "X" means that this preference is set, or "on."
If you want to turn this option off, use the <span class="keycap">X</span> ("Set/Unset") command to toggle the setting.
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
For a few options, you can choose one of many possible settings.
The option appears as a series of lines.
For instance, the first few lines of the
<em class="emphasis">saved-msg-name-rule</em> option look like this:
</p>

<p><blockquote><pre class="code">
saved-msg-name-rule      =
            Set    Rule Values
            ---  ----------------------
            (*)  by-from                      
            ( )  by-nick-of-from              
            ( )  by-nick-of-from-then-from    
            ( )  by-fcc-of-from               
            ( )  by-fcc-of-from-then-from     
</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>
The "*" means that the <em class="emphasis">saved-msg-name-rule</em> option
is currently set to <em class="emphasis">by-from</em>.
(Messages will be saved to a folder named for the person who
sent the message.)
If you wanted to choose a different setting--for instance,
<em class="emphasis">by-fcc-of-from</em>--you'd move the highlight to that
line and use the <span class="keycap">*</span> ("Select") command to choose that
setting.
</p>

<p>
These settings are trickier than the others, but the built-in help command
<span class="keycap">?</span> explains each choice in detail.
Start by highlighting the option name (here,
<em class="emphasis">saved-msg-name-rule</em>) and reading its help file.
Then look through the settings' names, highlight one you might want,
 and read its help file to see if it's right for you.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you exit the setup screen with the
<span class="keycap">E</span> command, Pine asks you to confirm whether you
want to save any option changes you made.
Answer <span class="keycap">N</span> if you were just experimenting or aren't sure.
