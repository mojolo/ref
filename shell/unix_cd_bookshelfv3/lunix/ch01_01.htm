Before you can use Unix, a system staff person has to set
up a Unix <em class="emphasis">account</em> for you.
The account is identified by your <em class="emphasis">username</em>, which
is usually a single word or an abbreviation.
Think of this account as your office--it's your place in the
Unix environment.
Other users may also be at work on the same system.
At many sites, there will be a whole network of Unix computers.
So in addition to knowing your username, you may also need to
know the <em class="emphasis">hostname</em> (name) of the computer that
has your account.
Alternatively, your account may be shared between all computers on the
local network, and you may be able to log into any of them.
</p><p>
<a name="IXT-1-279502" />
 Once you've logged in to your account, you'll interact with your
system by typing commands at a command line, to a program called a
<em class="emphasis">shell</em>.
You'll get acquainted with the shell, enter a few commands, and see how to
handle common problems.
To finish your Unix session, you'll log out.
</p><div class="sect1"><a name="lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1" />

<a name="IXT-1-279503" />
Each user communicates with the computer from a terminal.
To get into the Unix environment, you first connect to the Unix
computer.
(Your terminal is probably already connected to a computer.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a>
But Unix systems also let you log into other computers across a
network.
In this case, log into your local computer first, then use a
remote login command to connect to the remote computer.
See
<a href="ch06_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-1">Section 6.1</a> in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6</a>.)
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /><p> [1]

Some terminals can connect to many computers through a kind of switchboard
called a <em class="emphasis">port contender</em> or
<em class="emphasis">data switch</em>.
On these terminals, start by telling the port contender which
computer you want to connect to.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279504" />
After connecting your terminal, if needed,
you start a session by logging in to your Unix account.
To log in,
you need your username and a <em class="emphasis">password</em>.
Logging in does two things: it identifies which user is in a session,
and it tells the computer that you're ready to start work.
When you've finished, log out--and, if necessary,
disconnect from the Unix computer.
</p>

<blockquote><b>WARNING:</b> 
<a name="IXT-1-279505" />
If someone else has your username and password, they probably can
log into your account and do anything you can.
They can read private information, corrupt or delete
important files, send email messages as if they came from you, and more.
If your computer is connected to a network--the Internet or a
local network inside your organization--intruders may also
be able to log in without sitting at your keyboard!
See <a href="ch06_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-1">Section 6.1</a> in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6</a>
for one explanation of one way this can be done.
</p>

<p>

Anyone may be able to get your username--it's usually part of your
email address, for instance.
Your password is what keeps others from logging in as you.
Don't leave your password anywhere around your computer.
Don't give your password to anyone who asks you for it unless you're
sure they'll preserve your account security.
Also don't send your password by email; it can be stored, unprotected,
on other systems and on backup tapes, where other people may find
it and then break into your account.

</p>

<p>
If you suspect that someone is using your account, ask system staff for advice.
If you can't do that, setting a new password may help; see 
<a href="ch03_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-3-SECT-6">Section 3.6</a> in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279506" />
Unix systems are case sensitive.
Most usernames, commands, and filenames use lowercase letters
(though good passwords use a mixture of lower- and uppercase letters).
Before you log in, be sure your
<span class="keycap">CAPS LOCK</span> key is off.

If you see a message from the computer
that looks something like this:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
login:
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
you're probably connected!
You can skip ahead to
<a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.2">Section 1.1.2</a> and log in.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, if someone nearby uses the same kind of computer system you do,
the easiest way to find out if you're connected is probably to ask for help.
(We can't cover every user's situation exactly.
There are just too many possibilities.)
</p>

<p>
If there's no one to ask, look ahead at

If that doesn't help, but your computer seems to be running an operating
system other than Unix (such as Microsoft Windows),
check your menus and icons for one with the name
of the Unix computer you're supposed to connect to.
You might also find a program named either

<h3 class="sect2">1.1.2. Logging in Nongraphically</h3>

<p>
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-26" />
<a name="IXT-1-279517" />
The process of making yourself known to the computer system and
getting to your Unix account is called <em class="emphasis">logging in</em>.
If you've connected to the Unix host from another operating system,
you may have been logged into Unix automatically; in this case, you
should be able to run Unix programs, as shown later in this chapter in
<a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.4">Section 1.1.4</a> and
<a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.5">Section 1.1.5</a>.
Otherwise, before you can start work, you must connect your terminal or
terminal window to the computer you need (as in the previous section) and
identify yourself to the Unix system.
</p>


<p>

<a name="IXT-1-279518" />
There are generally two ways to log in: graphically and nongraphically.
If your screen has a window or windows floating in it, something like
<a href="ch02_02.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-FIG-2">Figure 2-2</a>A,
you probably need to log in graphically, as explained by
<a href="ch02_02.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-2.1">Section 2.2.1</a> in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2</a>.
</p>

<p>

Otherwise, to log in nongraphically,
enter your username (usually your name or initials) and your
private password.

The password does not appear as you enter it.
</p>

<p>
When you have logged in successfully, you'll get some system messages and
finally the shell prompt (where you can enter Unix commands).
A successful login to the system named <em class="emphasis">nutshell</em>
could look like <a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-EX-1">Example 1-1</a>.

In this example, the system messages include a maintenance notice, a "fortune," and the date.
Although this example doesn't show it, you may be asked for your
<em class="emphasis">terminal type</em>, accounting or chargeback information,
and so on.

<a name="IXT-1-279522" />
<a name="IXT-1-279523" />
<a name="IXT-1-279524" />
The last line to appear is the Unix shell prompt.
When you reach this point, you're logged in to your account and
can use Unix commands.
</p>

<p>
Instead of a shell prompt, you may get a menu of choices ("email," "news,"
and so on).
If one choice is something like "shell prompt" or
"command prompt," select it.
Then you'll be able to follow descriptions and examples in this book.
</p>

<p>


The messages you see at login time differ from system to system
and day to day.
Shell prompts can also differ.
Examples in this book use the currency sign <tt class="literal">$</tt>
as a prompt.
</p>

<p>
Let's summarize logging in nongraphically, step by step:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
If needed, connect your terminal or terminal window to the Unix system.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Get a "login:" prompt.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279525" />
Type in your username in <em class="emphasis">lowercase
letters</em> at the prompt.
For example, if your login name is "john," type:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
login: <tt class="userinput"><b>john</b></tt>
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Press the
<span class="keycap">RETURN</span>
key.
<a name="IXT-1-279526" />
</p>

<p>
The system should prompt you to enter your password.
If passwords aren't used on your system, you can skip the next step.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If you were assigned a password, type it at the prompt.
For security, your password is not displayed as you type it:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
Password:
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Press the
<span class="keycap">RETURN</span>
key.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The system checks your account name and password, and if they're
correct, logs you in to your account.

<dl>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Nothing seemed to happen after I logged in.</em></tt></i></dt>

Wait a minute, since the system may just be slow.
If you still get nothing, ask other users if they have the same
problem.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">The system says "login incorrect."</em></tt> </i></dt>
<dd>

If you have a choice of computer to log into (as we explained at the
start of this chapter in <a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1">Section 1.1</a>), check that you're connected to the right
computer. If you have accounts on several computers, be
sure you're using the correct username and password for this computer.
Otherwise, try logging in again, taking care to enter the
username and password correctly.
Be sure to type your username at the "login:" prompt and your password
at the "password:" prompt.
Backspacing may not work while entering either of these; if you make a
mistake, use <span class="keycap">RETURN</span>
to get a new "login:" prompt and try again.
Also make sure to use the exact combination of upper- and lowercase
letters your password contains.
</p>

<p>
If you still fail after trying to log in a few more times, check with
the person who created your account to confirm your username
and password.

<dt><em class="emphasis">All letters are in UPPERCASE and/or have 
backslashes</em></tt> (<tt class="literal">\</tt>) <em class="emphasis">before

<a name="IXT-1-279536" />
Once you have a shell prompt, you're working with a program called a
<em class="emphasis">shell</em>.
The shell interprets command lines you enter, runs programs
you ask for, and generally coordinates what happens between you and the
Unix operating system.
Common shells include Bourne (<b class="emphasis-bold">sh</b>),
Korn (<b class="emphasis-bold">ksh</b>), and
C (<b class="emphasis-bold">csh</b>) shells, as well
as <b class="emphasis-bold">bash</b> and
<b class="emphasis-bold">tcsh</b>.
</p>

<p>For a beginner, differences between shells are slight.
If you plan to work a lot with Unix, though, you should learn
more about your shell and its special commands.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-2" /><p> [2]
To find out which shell you're using, run the commands
<b class="emphasis-bold">echo $SHELL</b> and
<b class="emphasis-bold">ps $$</b>.
(See <a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.6">Section 1.1.6</a>, later in this chapter.)
The answer, something like <em class="emphasis">bash</em> or
<em class="emphasis">/bin/bash</em>, is your shell's name or pathname.

If you're using a window system, as described in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2</a>,
get a shell by opening a <em class="emphasis">terminal window</em>--if
you don't already have a terminal window open or iconified (minimized)
somewhere, that is.
(<a href="ch02_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-FIG-1">Figure 2-1</a> shows an example, but yours
may look different; the important thing is that the window have a
shell prompt in it.)
Check your menus and icons for a command with "terminal" or "term" in
its name, or a picture of a blank terminal (like a TV screen) in its
icon; one common program is <b class="emphasis-bold">xterm</b>.

<a name="IXT-1-279543" />

When the system is ready to run a command, the shell outputs a
<em class="emphasis">prompt</em> to tell you that you can enter a command line.
</p>

<p>
Shell prompts usually end with <tt class="literal">$</tt> or
<tt class="literal">%</tt>.
The prompt can be customized, though, so your own shell prompt may be
different.

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279544" />
<a name="IXT-1-279545" />
<a name="IXT-1-279546" />

A prompt that ends with a hash mark (<tt class="literal">#</tt>) usually means
that you're logged in as the <em class="emphasis">superuser</em>.
The superuser doesn't have the protections for standard
users that are built into the Unix system.
In this case, we recommend that you stop
work until you've found out how to access your personal Unix
account.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-3" /><p> [3]
This can happen if you're using a window system that was

<h3 class="sect2">1.1.6. Entering a Command Line</h3>

<a name="IXT-1-279547" />


Entering a command line at the shell prompt tells the computer what to do.
Each command line includes the name of a Unix program.
When you press <span class="keycap">RETURN</span>,
the shell interprets your command line and executes the program.
</p>

<p>The first word that you type at a shell prompt is always a Unix command
(or program name).
Like most things in Unix, program names are case sensitive; if the program
name is lowercase (and most are), you must type it in lowercase.
Some simple command lines have just one word, which is the program name.
For more information, see
<a href="ch01_02.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-2">Section 1.2</a>, later in this chapter.

An example single-word command is <b class="emphasis-bold">date</b>.

current date and time:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>date</b></tt>
Tue Oct  9 13:39:24 MST 2001
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
As you type a command line, the system simply collects your keyboard input.
Pressing the <span class="keycap">RETURN</span>
key tells the shell that you've finished entering text
and that it can run the program.
</p>
</div>

</p>

<p>
The <b class="emphasis-bold">who</b> program can also tell you
who is logged in at your terminal.
The command line is <b class="emphasis-bold">who am i</b>.
This command line consists of the command
(<b class="emphasis-bold">who</b>, the program's name) and arguments
(<b class="emphasis-bold">am i</b>).

<a name="lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.7. Recalling Previous Commands</h3>

<p>


Modern Unix shells remember command lines you've typed before.
They can even remember commands from previous login sessions.
This handy feature can save you a lot of retyping common commands.
As with many things in Unix, though, there are several different ways
to do this; we don't have room to show and explain them all.
You can get more information from sources listed in
<a href="ch08_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-8-SECT-1">Section 8.1</a> in <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279553" />
<a name="IXT-1-279554" />

After you've typed and executed several command lines, try pressing the
up-arrow key on your keyboard.
If your shell is configured to understand this, you should see the
previous command line after your shell prompt, just as you typed it
before.
Pressing the up-arrow again recalls the previous command line, and so on.
Also, as you'd expect, the down-arrow key will recall more recent command lines.
</p>

<p>
To execute one of these remembered commands, just press the
<span class="keycap">RETURN</span> key.
(Your cursor doesn't have to be at the end of the command line.)
</p>

<p>
Once you've recalled a command line, you can also edit it.
If you don't want to execute any remembered commands, cancel the command
line with <span class="keycap">CTRL-C</span>.
Next, <a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.8">Section 1.1.8</a>
explains both of these.

<a name="IXT-1-279555" />
<a name="IXT-1-279556" />
What if you make a mistake in a command line?
Suppose you typed <b class="emphasis-bold">dare</b> instead of
<b class="emphasis-bold">date</b> and pressed the
<span class="keycap">RETURN</span> key before you realized your mistake.
The shell will give you an error message:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>dare</b></tt>
dare: command not found
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Don't be too concerned about getting error messages.
Sometimes you'll get an error even if it appears that you typed the
command correctly.
This can be caused by typing control characters that are invisible on
the screen.
Once the prompt returns, reenter your command.
</p>

<p>
As we said earlier (in <a href="ch01_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-1-SECT-1.7">Section 1.1.7</a>)
most modern shells let you recall previous commands and edit command
lines.
If you'll do a lot of work at the shell prompt, it's worth learning
these handy techniques.
They take more time to learn than we can spend here, though--except
to mention that, on those shells, the left-arrow and right-arrow keys
may move your cursor along the command line to the point where you want
to make a change.
Here, let's concentrate on simple methods that work with all shells.
</p>

<p>
If you see a mistake before you press <span class="keycap">RETURN</span>,
you can use the
<em class="emphasis">erase character</em>
to erase and correct the mistake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279557" />
The erase character differs from system to system and from
account to account, and can be customized.
The most common erase characters are:
</p>

<ul>

<a name="IXT-1-279558" />
<li>
<p>
<span class="keycap">BACKSPACE</span>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<span class="keycap">DELETE</span>,
<span class="keycap">DEL</span>,
or
<span class="keycap">RUBOUT</span>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<span class="keycap">CTRL-H</span>
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
<span class="keycap">CTRL-H</span>
<a name="IXT-1-279559" />
<a name="IXT-1-279560" />
is called a <em class="emphasis">control character</em>.
To type a control character (for example, <span class="keycap">CTRL-H</span>),
hold down the <span class="keycap">CTRL</span> key, then press the letter "h."
In the text, we will write control characters as <span class="keycap">CTRL-H</span>,
but in the examples, we will use the standard notation: <tt class="literal">^H</tt>.
This is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same as pressing the
<tt class="literal">^</tt> (caret) key, letting
go, and then typing an H!
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279561" />
<a name="IXT-1-279562" />
<a name="IXT-1-279563" />
<a name="IXT-1-279564" />
The key labeled <span class="keycap">DEL</span>
may be used as the <em class="emphasis">interrupt character</em> instead of
the erase character.
(It's labeled <span class="keycap">DELETE</span> or <span class="keycap">RUBOUT</span>
on some terminals.)
This key is used to interrupt or cancel a command, and can be used in
many (but not all) cases when you want to quit what you're doing.
Another character often programmed to do the same thing is
<span class="keycap">CTRL-C</span>.
</p>

<p>
Other common control characters are:
</p>


<dl>

<dt><i><span class="keycap">CTRL-U</span></i></dt>
<dd>

Erases the whole input line; you can start over.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><span class="keycap">CTRL-S</span></i></dt>
<dd>

Pauses output from a program that's writing to the screen.
This can be confusing; we don't recommend using <span class="keycap">CTRL-S</span>,
but want you to be aware of it.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><span class="keycap">CTRL-Q</span></i></dt>
<dd>

Restarts output after a pause by
<span class="keycap">CTRL-S</span>.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><i><span class="keycap">CTRL-D</span></i></dt>
<dd>

Used to signal end-of-input for some programs (such as
<b class="emphasis-bold">cat</b> and <b class="emphasis-bold">mail</b>,
explained in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5</a> and <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6</a>) and return you to a shell prompt.
If you type <span class="keycap">CTRL-D</span> at a shell prompt, it may close your
terminal window or log you out of the Unix system.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Find the erase and interrupt characters for your account and write
them here:
</p>


<p>_______   Backspace and erase a character</p>

<p>_______   Interrupt a program</p>

<a name="IXT-1-279567" />
<a name="IXT-1-279568" />
To end a Unix session, you must log out.
You should <em class="emphasis">not</em> end a session by just turning off
your terminal!
</p>

<p>
If you're using a window system, first close open windows and then close
the window system;
see <a href="ch02_09.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-9">Section 2.9</a> in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2</a> for more information.
If you logged in graphically, that should end your login session.
But, if you logged in nongraphically before you started the window
system, closing the window system should take you back to a shell prompt
(where you originally typed <b class="emphasis-bold">xinit</b> or
<b class="emphasis-bold">startx</b>).
In that case, use the following steps to finish logging out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279569" />
<a name="IXT-1-279570" />

If you aren't currently using a window system,
you can log out by entering
the command <b class="emphasis-bold">exit</b> at a shell prompt.
(In many cases, the command <b class="emphasis-bold">logout</b> will
also work.)
Depending on your shell, you may also be able to log out simply by typing
<span class="keycap">CTRL-D</span>.
</p>

<p>
What happens next depends on the place from which you've logged in:
if your terminal is connected directly to the computer,
the "login:" prompt should appear on the screen.
Otherwise, if you were connected to a remote computer, the shell
prompt from your local computer should reappear on your screen.
(That is, you're still logged in to your local computer.)
Repeat the process if you want to log out from the local computer.
</p>

<p>
After you've logged out, you can turn off your terminal or leave
it on for the next user.
But, if the power switch for your terminal is the same as the power
switch for the whole Unix computer system, do <em class="emphasis">not</em>
simply turn off that power switch!
Ask a local expert for help with shutting down your Unix system safely.

<p>
<a name="IXT-1-279571" />
The first few times you use Unix, you aren't likely to have the
following problems. But
you may encounter these problems later, as you do more
advanced work.
</p>

<dl>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">You get another shell prompt or the shell
says "logout: not login shell"</em></tt></b></dt>
<dd>

You've been using a subshell (a shell created by your
original login shell).
To end each subshell, type <b class="emphasis-bold">exit</b> (or just
type <span class="keycap">CTRL-D</span>) until you're logged out.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><b>

<em class="emphasis">The shell says "There are stopped jobs" or "There are running jobs."</em></tt>

</b></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-1-279572" />
<a name="IXT-1-279573" />
<a name="IXT-1-279574" />
Many Unix systems have a feature called <em class="emphasis">job control</em>
that lets you suspend a program temporarily while it's running or
keep it running separately in the "background."
One or more programs you ran during your session has not ended,
but is stopped (paused) or in the background.
Enter <b class="emphasis-bold">fg</b> to bring each stopped job into
the foreground, then quit the program normally.
