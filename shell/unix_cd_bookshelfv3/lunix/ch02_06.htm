<h2 class="sect1">2.6. Other Window Manager Features</h2>

<p>

<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-256" />


Your window manager and/or desktop environment may have some other
handy features.
Let's look at two.
Explore these after you've learned more basic operations;
they can be real timesavers!
</p>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.1. Panel</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-2-279698" />
A <em class="emphasis">panel</em> is a thin bar across the top or bottom of the
screen.
If you have a panel, it probably has icons you can click to launch a program.
It also may have a row of buttons, one for each window that's either open
or minimized (or both); you can use these buttons to open a minimized window
or raise an open window to the top of a stack.
If you move the mouse pointer over an object without clicking, a "tool tip"
box may appear with more information about it.
You also can try clicking on these and/or holding down your mouse
buttons (try each mouse button, in turn) to see what they might do.
</p>
</div>

<a name="lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.2. Pagers and Virtual Desktops</h3>


<p>
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-258" />
<a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-259" />

Sophisticated window managers can manage multiple desktops on
the same physical screen.
A <em class="emphasis">pager</em> lets you choose between these
<em class="emphasis">virtual desktops</em>.
Each virtual desktop is like the desktop you see when you open the
window system--but you can open different windows on each virtual
desktop.
It's kind of like having two or more separate physical terminals
stacked on top of each other, as well as side-to-side, on your
desk--each with its own desktop displayed,
all driven from the same keyboard and mouse.
All virtual desktops appear on the same screen,
but only one is visible at a time.
If you're using GNOME or KDE, you may have four virtual desktops
available automatically, though that number can be changed.
</p>

<p>Think of these desktops arranged in a grid, as
<a href="ch02_06.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-FIG-6">Figure 2-6</a> 
shows.
You can refer to the desktops by saying "the desktop above" or "the
desktop to the right"; they may also be numbered.
The window manager has commands to let you move a window from one
desktop to another (see <a href="ch02_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-5.5">Section 2.5.5</a>, earlier in this chapter).
You also may be able to use the mouse to drag a window
"off the edge" of one desktop and onto the next.
</p>

<p>
If you're working on three projects, for instance, each project can have
its own desktop, where you can put all the windows for that project.
The pager lets you choose which desktop you want
to see.
If your window manager has a panel, each virtual desktop probably has its own
panel.

Some icons or windows may appear on all desktops;
others may appear on just one desktop.
For instance, if your system has a console window where you can monitor
system log messages, you might want to see that window from
every desktop.
(Under the Enlightenment window manager, for instance, this is called
making a window "stick" to all desktops.
On KDE, clicking the push-pin icon near the top left corner of a window
frame does the same thing.)
But another window--such as a text editor on which you're writing a report
about a particular project--should be open only on the desktop where
you need it.

By the way, many window-based programs--such as web browsers--can
open multiple windows.
It's usually more efficient to start the program <em class="emphasis">just once</em>,
and put its windows on the desktops where you need them,
instead of starting a new instance of the program on every desktop.
For example, instead of clicking the Netscape icon to start the browser
program running on every desktop, click that icon on one desktop and use
Netscape's "New Window" command to open multiple windows.
You then move each new Netscape window to the desktop where you want it.
(In case you need to clear all of the windows from one desktop, though,
remember to use Netscape's "Close Window" command instead of its
"Quit Netscape" command!
Quitting Netscape in this situation would remove all of its windows from
<em class="emphasis">all</em> of the desktops.)
