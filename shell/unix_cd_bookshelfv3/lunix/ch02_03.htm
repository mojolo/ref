A window manager can open windows of its own.
But the main use of a window manager is to manage windows opened
by other programs.
We mention a few window programs here; <a href="ch02_08.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-8">Section 2.8</a>, near the end of this chapter,
has more.
</p>

<p><a name="lunix5-IDXTERM-166" />
One of the most important X features is that windows can come either from
programs running on your local computer, or over a network from programs
running on remote computers.
The remote computers can run Unix or another operating system.
So, if your favorite program from another operating system doesn't run under
Unix but has an X interface, you may be able to run that program on its
native OS and display its windows with X on your Unix computer.
(Check your program's documentation; see
<a href="ch08_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-8-SECT-1">Section 8.1</a> in <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8</a>.)
Researchers can run graphical data analysis programs on supercomputers
in other parts of the country and see the results in their offices.
There's much more than we can explain here.
We cover the basics here and in
<a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6</a> in
<a href="ch06_02.htm#lunix5-CHP-6-SECT-2">Section 6.2</a>,
which also has a figure showing how this works.
If you'll do a lot of work with X, you may want a detailed
reference that explains X and your window manager.

<p>
<a name="IXT-2-279632" />
<a name="IXT-2-279633" />
<a name="IXT-2-279634" />


Of all the windows on your screen, only one window receives the keystrokes
you type.
This window is usually highlighted in some way.
For instance, the titlebar of the
window that receives your input may be blue instead of the default grey color.
In X jargon, choosing the window you type to is called
<a name="IXT-2-279635" />
<a name="IXT-2-279636" />
"setting the <em class="emphasis">input focus</em>."
Most window managers can be configured to set the focus in one of the
following ways:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Move the mouse pointer into a window and click a mouse button (usually the
first button; see <a href="ch02_04.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-4">Section 2.4</a>, later in this chapter).
In some systems, you may need to click on the titlebar at the top of the
window.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Simply move the pointer inside a window.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Your window manager may be configured to give the input focus
automatically to any new windows that pop up.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.3.2. Terminal Windows</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-2-279637" />
<a name="IXT-2-279638" />
One of the most important windows is a <em class="emphasis">terminal window</em>.
A terminal window has a Unix session inside with a shell prompt, just like a miniature alphanumeric terminal.
You can have several terminal windows running at
the same time, each doing something different.
To enter a Unix command or answer a prompt in a window, set the focus
there and type.
Programs in other windows will keep running; if they need input from you,
they'll wait just as they would on a standard terminal.
</p>

<p>


<a name="IXT-2-279639" />
<a name="IXT-2-279640" />


Quite a few programs make terminal windows.
One of the best-known programs is
<b class="emphasis-bold">xterm</b>.
Others include GNOME Terminal and
<b class="emphasis-bold">konsole</b>.
All perform the same basic job: they allow you to interact with
Unix from a shell prompt.
</p>

<p>
<a href="ch02_02.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-FIG-2">Figure 2-2</a>D
and
<a href="ch02_05.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-FIG-4">Figure 2-4</a>
show a single terminal window with a
shell prompt (<tt class="literal">$</tt>).
If you enter a Unix command (such as <b class="emphasis-bold">date</b>)
at the prompt,
it runs just as it would on a terminal that isn't under the X Window System.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-2-279641" />
<a name="IXT-2-279642" />
You can also start other X-based window programs (sometimes
called <em class="emphasis">X clients</em>) by entering the program's
name at a shell prompt in any terminal window.
Although you can start new programs (such as terminal windows,
<b class="emphasis-bold">xcalc</b>, and so on) from any open
terminal window on your computer, we
recommend starting them all from the first terminal window that you open.
If you do that, and if your shell has job control (see
<a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7</a>), it's easy to
find and control all the other programs and their windows.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example.
<a name="IXT-2-279643" />
<a name="IXT-2-279644" />
To start the calculator called <b class="emphasis-bold">xcalc</b>,
enter this command from a terminal window:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>xcalc &amp;</b></tt>
[1] 12345
$
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-2-279645" />
<a name="IXT-2-279646" />

The shell will put the process in the background--so you get another
shell prompt right away--and will print a process ID (PID) number,
such as 12345.
(<a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7</a> has more information on this subject.)
If you forget to add the ampersand (<tt class="literal">&amp;</tt>) at the
end of the line, then
kill (terminate) the <b class="emphasis-bold">xcalc</b> program
from the terminal window where you started it by typing your
interrupt character (such as <span class="keycap">CTRL-C</span>).
You should get another shell prompt, where you can re-enter
the <b class="emphasis-bold">xcalc</b> command correctly.
</p>

<p>
The new window may be placed and get the focus automatically.
Or, the window (or an outline of it) may "float" above the screen,
following the pointer, until you point somewhere and click the
first mouse button to place the window.
</p>

<p>
You can also start a new terminal window
from an existing one.
Just enter the program's name and an ampersand (for example,
<b class="emphasis-bold">xterm &amp;</b>)
at the shell prompt.
Don't forget the ampersand.
</p>

<p>
The same method will start other X programs.
(Later in this chapter, <a href="ch02_08.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-SECT-8">Section 2.8</a>
lists some
standard X programs.)

<h3 class="sect2">2.3.3. Window Manager Menus</h3>

<p>


<a name="IXT-2-279647" />
<a name="IXT-2-279648" />
<a name="IXT-2-279649" />


Your window manager probably has one or more menus, buttons, and dialogs of
its own.
These let you control the way the window manager works, overall.
They may also launch programs, open the help system, and do other useful
things that don't apply to all programs and windows that are
currently open (things you can't do with
an individual program's own menus, that is).
For instance, a window manager menu might let you set how many
rows of program launching buttons are in the panel or the color of the
frame around each window.
</p>

<p>
Different window managers have different ways to do these things.
To find the menus on your window manager, read its documentation or
experiment a bit.
You might also find that pressing different mouse buttons will open
different menus.
You may need to hold down the button to keep a menu visible.
Move your mouse pointer around to places shown in the following, then try your mouse
buttons:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The desktop (outside any of your open windows)
</p></li>

<li><p>
An icon with a logo--for example, the KDE gear with a K over it
or the GNOME footprint
</p></li>

<li><p>
A blank part of some standard feature of your desktop--for
instance, an empty part of the panel
</p></li>

<li><p>
Any little feature that doesn't seem to apply to a particular program
(that isn't a program icon and doesn't have the title of a program or
open window)--for instance, the small triangle to the right of
the pager shown in
<a href="ch02_01.htm#lunix5-CHP-2-FIG-1">Figure 2-1</a>
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="IXT-2-279650" />
<a name="IXT-2-279651" />
<a name="IXT-2-279652" />
You probably can add commands to some menus, or more
icons to a group of program-launching icons.
You might add window manager operations or commands to open other windows.
For example, a "New Window" menu item can open a new
terminal window for you.
A "Calculator" item could start <b class="emphasis-bold">xcalc</b>.
Different window managers have different ways to do this.
Check your documentation.
To add a command, you'll need to specify either the program name (such as
<b class="emphasis-bold">xterm</b> or <b class="emphasis-bold">mozilla</b>)
or the absolute pathname of its executable file (such as
<em class="emphasis">/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm</em>).
The absolute pathname varies system-to-system; you might find
it using the command <b class="emphasis-bold">which</b> or
<b class="emphasis-bold">type</b> from a shell prompt, like this:
</p>

<p><blockquote><pre class="code">
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>type xterm</b></tt>
xterm is /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
$ <tt class="userinput"><b>which xterm</b></tt>
/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
</pre></blockquote></p>
