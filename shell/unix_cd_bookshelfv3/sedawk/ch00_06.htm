<h2 class="sect1">0.6. Acknowledgments from the First Edition</h2>

<p>To say that this book has been long anticipated is no understatement.
I published three articles on awk in <em class="emphasis">UNIX/World</em> in the spring and
summer of 1987, making the mistake of saying that these articles were
from the upcoming Nutshell Handbook, <em class="citetitle">Sed &amp;
Awk</em>. I proposed to Tim O'Reilly that I adapt the articles
and create a book as a project I could work on at home shortly after
the birth of my son, Benjamin.  I thought I'd finish it in several
months. Well, my son turned three around the time I was completing the
first draft.  Cathy Brennan and the customer service representatives
have been patiently handling requests for the book ever since the
<em class="emphasis">UNIX/World</em> articles appeared.  Cathy said that she even had people
call to order the book, swearing it was available because they knew
other people who had read it.  I owe a debt of gratitude to her and
her staff and to the readers I've kept waiting.</p>

<p>My thanks to Tim O'Reilly for creating a great company in which one can
easily get sidetracked by a number of interesting projects.  As editor,
he pushed me to complete the book but would not allow it to be complete
without his writing all over it.  As usual, his suggestions made
me work to improve the book.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the writers and production editors at O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, who presented interesting problems to be solved with sed
and awk.  Thanks to Ellie Cutler who was the production editor for the
book and also wrote the index.  Thanks to Lenny Muellner for allowing
me to quote him throughout the book.  Thanks as well to Sue Willing
and Donna Woonteiler for their efforts in getting the book into print.
Thanks to Chris Reilley who did the illustrations.  Thanks to the
individual contributors of the sed and awk scripts in 
<a href="ch13_01.htm">Chapter 13, "A Miscellany of Scripts"</a>.  Thanks also to Kevin C. Castner, Tim Irvin,
Mark Schalz, Alex Humez, Glenn Saito, Geoff Hagel, Tony Hurson, Jerry
Peek, Mike Tiller, and Lenny Muellner, who sent me mail pointing out
typos and errors.</p>

<p>Finally, dearest thanks to Nancy and Katie, Ben and Glenda.</p>
