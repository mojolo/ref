Sed is a
"non-interactive" stream-oriented editor.  It is stream-oriented
because, like many UNIX programs, input flows through the program and
is directed to standard output.  (<b class="emphasis-bold">vi</b>, for instance,
is not stream-oriented.  Nor are most DOS applications.)  Input
typically comes from a file but can be directed from the
keyboard.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> 
Output goes to the terminal screen by default but can be captured in a
file instead.  Sed works by interpreting a script specifying the
actions to be performed.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p> [7]Doing so, however, is not particularly useful.</p>

Sed offers capabilities that seem a natural extension of interactive
text editing.  For instance, it offers a search-and-replace facility
that can be applied globally to a single file or a group of files.
While you would not typically use sed to change a term that appears
once in a particular file, you will find it very useful to make a
series of changes across a number of files.  Think about making 20
different edits in over 100 files in a matter of minutes, and you get
an idea of how powerful sed can be.</p>

<p>Using sed is similar to writing simple shell scripts (or batch files
in DOS).  You specify a series of actions to be performed in sequence.
Most of these actions could be done manually from within
<b class="emphasis-bold">vi</b>: replacing text, deleting lines, inserting new
text, etc.  The advantage of sed is that you can specify all editing
instructions in one place and then execute them on a single pass
through the file.  You don't have to go into each file to make each
change.  Sed can also be used effectively to edit very large files
that would be slow to edit interactively.</p>

<p>There are many opportunities to use sed in the course of creating and
maintaining a document, especially when the document consists of
individual chapters, each placed in a separate file.  Typically, after
a draft of a document has returned from review, there are a number of
changes that can be applied to all files.  For instance, during the
course of a software documentation project, the name of the software
or its components might change, and you have to track down and make
these changes.  With sed, this is a simple process.</p>

<p>Sed can be used to achieve consistency throughout a document.  You can
search for all the different ways a particular term might be used and
make them all the same.  You can use sed to insert special typesetting
codes or symbols prior to formatting by <b class="emphasis-bold">troff</b>.  For
instance, it can be used to replace quotation marks with the ASCII
character codes for forward and back double quotes ("curly quotes"
instead of "straight" quotes).</p>

<p>Sed also has the ability to be used as an editing
<em class="emphasis">filter</em>.  In other words, you could process an
input file and send the output to another program.  For instance, you
could use sed to analyze a plain text file and insert
<b class="emphasis-bold">troff</b> macros before directing the output to
<b class="emphasis-bold">troff</b> for formatting.  It allows you to make edits
on the fly, perhaps ones that are temporary.</p>

<p>An author or publisher can use sed to write numerous conversion
programs--translating formatting codes in Scribe or  files
into <b class="emphasis-bold">troff</b>, for example, or converting PC word processing files, such as WordStar.  Later on, we will look
at a sed script that converts <b class="emphasis-bold">troff</b> macros into
stylesheet tags for use in Ventura Publisher.  (Perhaps sed could be
used to translate a program written in the syntax of one language to
the syntax of another language.)  When Sun Microsystems first produced
Xview, they released a conversion program for converting SunView
programs to XView, and the program largely consisted of sed scripts,
converting the names of various functions.</p>

<p>Sed has a few rudimentary programming constructs that can be used to
build more complicated scripts.  It also has a limited ability to
work on more than one line at a time.</p>

<p>All but the simplest sed scripts are usually invoked from a "shell
wrapper," a shell script that invokes sed and also contains the
commands that sed executes.  A shell wrapper is an easy way to name
and execute a single-word command.  Users of the command don't even
need to know that sed is being used.  One example of such a shell
wrapper is the script <b class="emphasis-bold">phrase</b>, which we'll look at
later in this book.  It allows you to match a pattern that might fall
over two lines, addressing a specific limitation of
<b class="emphasis-bold">grep</b>.</p>

<p>In summary, use sed:</p>

<ol><li><p>To automate editing actions to be performed on one or more files.</p></li><li><p>To simplify the task of performing the same edits on multiple files.</p></li><li><p>To write conversion programs.</p></li></ol>
