<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1><p>This book is about a set of oddly named UNIX utilities, 
<b class="emphasis-bold">sed</b> and <b class="emphasis-bold">awk</b>.
These utilities have many things in common, including the use of
regular expressions for pattern matching.  Since pattern matching is
such an important part of their use, this book explains UNIX regular
expression syntax very thoroughly.  Because there is a natural
progression in learning from <b class="emphasis-bold">grep</b> to
sed to awk, we will be covering all three programs, although the focus
is on sed and awk.</p><p>Sed and awk are tools used by users, programmers, and system
administrators--anyone working with text files.  Sed, so called
because it is a stream editor, is perfect for applying a series of
edits to a number of files.  Awk, named after its developers Aho,
Weinberger, and Kernighan, is a programming language that permits easy
manipulation of structured data and the generation of formatted
reports.  This book emphasizes the POSIX definition of awk.  In
addition, the book briefly describes the original version of awk,
before discussing three freely available versions of awk and two
commercial ones, all of which implement POSIX awk.</p><p>The focus of this book is on writing scripts for sed and awk that
quickly solve an assortment of problems for the user.  Many of these
scripts could be called "quick-fixes."  In addition, we'll cover
scripts that solve larger problems that require more careful design
and development.</p><div class="sect1"><a name="sedawk-ch-0-sect-1" />
<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />0.1. Scope of This Handbook</h2>

<p><a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Power Tools for Editing"</a>, is an overview of 
the features and capabilities of sed and awk.</p>

<p><a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Understanding
Basic Operations"</a>, demonstrates the basic operations of sed
and awk, showing a progression in functionality from sed to awk.  Both
share a similar command-line syntax, accepting user instructions in
the form of a script.</p>

<p><a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Understanding Regular Expression Syntax"</a>, describes UNIX regular expression syntax
in full detail.  New users are often intimidated by these strange
expressions, used for pattern matching.  It is important to master
regular expression syntax to get the most from sed and awk.  The
pattern-matching examples in this chapter largely rely on
<b class="emphasis-bold">grep</b> and <b class="emphasis-bold">egrep</b>.</p>

<p><a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Writing sed Scripts"</a>, begins a three-chapter section on sed.
This chapter covers the basic elements of writing a sed script using
only a few sed commands.  It also presents a shell script that
simplifies invoking sed scripts.</p>

<p><a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Basic sed Commands"</a>, and <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Advanced sed
Commands"</a>, divide
the sed command set into basic and advanced commands.  The basic
commands are commands that parallel manual editing actions, while the
advanced commands introduce simple programming capabilities.  Among
the advanced commands are those that manipulate the hold space, a
set-aside temporary buffer.</p>

<p><a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "Writing Scripts
for awk"</a>, begins a five-chapter section on awk.
This chapter presents the primary features of this scripting language.
A number of scripts are explained, including one that modifies the
output of the <b class="emphasis-bold">ls</b> command.</p>

<p><a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "Conditionals, Loops, and Arrays"</a>, describes how to use common programming
constructs such as conditionals, loops, and arrays.</p>

<p><a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Functions"</a>, describes how to use awk's built-in
functions as well as how to write user-defined functions.</p>

<p><a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "The Bottom Drawer"</a>, covers a set of miscellaneous awk
topics.  It describes how to execute UNIX commands from an awk script
and how to direct output to files and pipes.  It then offers some
(meager) advice on debugging awk scripts.</p>

<p><a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, "A Flock of awks"</a>, describes the original V7 version of
awk, the current Bell Labs awk, GNU awk (gawk) from the Free Software
Foundation, and mawk, by Michael Brennan.  The latter three all have
freely available source code.  This chapter also describes two
commercial implementations, MKS awk and Thomson Automation awk
(<b class="emphasis-bold">tawk</b>), as well as VSAwk, which brings awk-like
capabilities to the Visual Basic environment.</p>

<p><a href="ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, "Full-Featured Applications"</a>, presents two longer, more complex awk
scripts that together demonstrate nearly all the features of the
language.  The first script is an interactive spelling checker.  The
second script processes and formats the index for a book or a master
index for a set of books.</p>

<p><a href="ch13_01.htm">Chapter 13, "A Miscellany of Scripts"</a>, presents a number of user-contributed
scripts that show different styles and techniques of writing scripts
for sed and awk.</p>

<p><a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A, "Quick Reference for sed"</a>, is a quick reference describing sed's
commands and command-line options.</p>

<p><a href="appb_01.htm">Appendix B, "Quick Reference
for awk"</a>, is a quick reference to awk's
command-line options and a full description of its scripting language.</p>

<p><a href="appc_01.htm">Appendix C, "Supplement for Chapter 12"</a>, presents the full listings for the
<b class="emphasis-bold">spellcheck.awk</b> script and the
<b class="emphasis-bold">masterindex</b> shell script described in 
<a href="ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, "Full-Featured Applications"</a>.</p>
