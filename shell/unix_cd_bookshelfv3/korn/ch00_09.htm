<h2 class="sect1">0.9. Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>
Writing a book from scratch isn't easy.  Updating a book is even harder;
the trick is to make it impossible (or at least difficult) for the reader
to tell which author wrote what parts.  I hope I've succeeded
in that.  I want to acknowledge Bill Rosenblatt for writing the first
edition and giving me an excellent body of material with which to work.
This is one of the best O'Reilly books I've ever read, and it was a
pleasure to work with it.
</p>

<p>
I would like to thank (in alphabetical order)
Nelson A. Beebe (University of Utah Mathematics department),
Dr. David G. Korn (AT&amp;T Research),
Chet Ramey (maintainer of <em class="emphasis">bash</em>),
Bill Rosenblatt (GiantSteps/Media Technology Strategies),
and
Dr. Eugene H. Spafford (Purdue University Computer Science department)
for reviewing the book and providing many helpful comments.
Mike Loukides, the book's editor, was very patient with me
during several delays in the update.
David Chu, of O'Reilly's editorial staff,
did a great job making sure that many of the "nuts and bolts"
parts of the project got done, for which I'm grateful.
</p>

<p>
David Korn, now of AT&amp;T Research Laboratories, and
author of the Korn shell, answered a number of
questions and provided early access to <em class="emphasis">ksh93l</em>
documentation, which helped considerably, as well as
prerelease access to <em class="emphasis">ksh93n</em>.
Glenn Fowler, also of AT&amp;T Research, helped with
compilation issues under GNU/Linux, as well as helping me
understand a number of the finer points of <em class="emphasis">ksh</em> usage.
Steve Alston provided some improvements to the
<em class="emphasis">kshdb</em> debugger in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9</a>.
George Kraft IV provided helpful information on <em class="emphasis">dtksh</em>
for <a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A</a>.
Glenn Barry, of Sun Microsystems, provided information
on <em class="emphasis">zsh</em> for <a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Phil Hughes, president of SSC, for permission to reprint
parts of their <em class="emphasis">ksh</em> reference card.
</p>

<p>
Several other staff members at O'Reilly contributed to the book, as
well: Leanne Soylemez was the production editor and proofreader; Mary
Brady and Jane Ellin provided additional quality control; Brenda
Miller wrote the index.
</p>

<p>
Finally, thanks to my wonderful wife Miriam, for not demanding
the attention she was entitled to
on way too many nights while I worked on this book.
Without her, nothing would be worth doing.
</p>
