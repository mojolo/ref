<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1><p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>
<p>The animal on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Learning the Korn Shell</em> is a hawksbill
turtle. The name "hawksbill" refers to its prominent hooked beak. This
marine reptile is one of the smaller sea turtles, having a carapace
(upper shell) length of about two feet and weighing about one hundred
pounds. Among pelagic turtles, the hawksbill alone has the tendency to
feed and breed in the same area, preferring the tropical shoals and
reefs of the world's oceans.</p>
<p>Primarily carnivorous, the hawksbill feeds on crabs, fish, sponges,
and jellyfish. The turtle's flesh can be poisonous; in some places,
fisherman test for poison by throwing the turtle's liver to the
crows. If the birds reject the liver, the hawksbill is toxic.</p>
<p>The hawksbill turtle is the sole source of authentic "tortoiseshell,"
which comes from the scutes, or outer layer of the
carapace. Tortoiseshell has been harvested through the years--from
ancient Egypt to the present--and is highly valued for its beauty and
plasticity. As a result, the hawksbill is endangered. Illegal trade
continues to threaten this species' existence.</p><p>Leanne Soylemez was the production editor and proofreader for <em class="citetitle">Learning the Korn Shell</em>, Second Edition. Kate Briggs was the copyeditor. Mary Brady and Jane Ellin provided quality control. Brenda Miller wrote the index.</p><p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book. The cover image is a
19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby
produced the cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC
Garamond font. </p><p>Melanie Wang and David Futato designed the interior layout based on a series design by Nancy Priest. The print version of this book was created by translating the DocBook XML markup of its source files into a set of <em class="emphasis">gtroff</em> macros using a filter developed at O'Reilly &amp; Associates by Norman Walsh. Steve Talbott designed and wrote the underlying macro set on the basis of the GNU <em class="emphasis">troff -mgs macros</em>; Lenny Muellner adapted them to XML and implemented the book design. The GNU <em class="emphasis">groff</em> text formatter version 1.11.1 was used to generate PostScript output. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book; the code font is Constant Willison. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano, Jessamyn Read, and Chris Reilley, using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Michael Kalantarian.</p><p>The online edition of this book was created by the Safari
production group (John Chodacki, Becki Maisch, and Madeleine Newell)
using a set of Frame-to-XML conversion and cleanup tools written and
maintained by Erik Ray, Benn Salter, John Chodacki, and Jeff
Liggett.</p>
