A common synonym for a Unix shell, or for the interface any
computer program presents, is an environment.
An <em class="emphasis">environment</em> is typically a collection of concepts
that expresses the things a computer does in terms
designed to be understandable and coherent, and a look and feel that is comfortable.
</p><p>

For example, your desk at work is an environment. Concepts
involved in desk work usually include memos, phone calls, letters,
forms, etc. The tools on or in your desk that you use to
deal with these things include paper, staples, envelopes,
pens, a telephone, a calculator, etc. Every one of these has a
set of characteristics that express how you use it; such
characteristics range from location on your desk or in a drawer
(for simple tools) to more sophisticated things like which numbers
the memory buttons on your phone are set to. Taken together,
these characteristics make up your desk's look and feel.
</p><p>
You customize the look and feel of your
desk environment by putting pens where you can most easily reach
them, programming your phone buttons, etc. In general,
the more customization you have done, the more tailored to your
personal needs -- and therefore the more productive -- your
environment is.
</p><p>
Similarly, Unix shells present you with
such concepts as files, directories, and standard input
and output, while Unix itself gives you
tools to work with these, such as file manipulation
commands, text editors, and print queues. Your Unix environment's
look and feel is determined by your keyboard and display, of course,
but also by how you set up your directories, where you put each
kind of file, and what names you give to files, directories, and commands.
There are also more sophisticated ways of customizing your shell
environment.
<a name="IXTR3-112" />
</p><p>
The most basic means of customization that the Korn shell provides
are these:
</p><dl>
<dt><i>Aliases</i></dt>
<dd>

<a name="IXT-3-287322" />
Synonyms for commands or command strings
that you can define for convenience.
</p></dd>


<dt><i>Options</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-3-287323" />

Controls for various aspects of your environment,
which you can turn on and off.
</p></dd>


<dt><i>Variables</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-3-287324" />

Placeholders for information that
tell the shell and other programs
how to behave under various circumstances.
</p></dd>

</dl><p>
There are also more complex ways to customize your environment, mainly the ability to
program the shell, which we will see in later chapters. In this
chapter, we cover the techniques listed above.
</p><p>
While most of the customizations obtainable with the above
techniques are straightforward and apply to everyday Unix use,
others are rather arcane and require in-depth technical
knowledge to understand. Most of this chapter concentrates on
the former. Because we want to explain things from the perspective
of tasks you may want to perform, rather than that of the specific
features of the Korn shell, a few little details may fall through
the cracks (such as miscellaneous options to certain commands).
We suggest you look in <a href="appb_01.htm">Appendix B</a> for this type of information.

<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />3.1. The .profile File</h2>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-287325" />

If you want to customize your environment,
it is most important to know about a file called <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> in your home
(login) directory. This is a file of shell commands, also called
a shell script, that the Korn shell reads and runs whenever
you log in to your system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-287326" />

If you use a large machine in an
office or department, the odds are good that your system
administrator has already set up a <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> file
for you that contains
a few standard things. This is one of the "hidden" files mentioned
in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1</a>; other common hidden files include <em class="emphasis">.xinitrc</em></tt> (for the X
Window System), <em class="emphasis">.emacs</em></tt> (for the GNU Emacs editor),
and <em class="emphasis">.mailrc</em></tt> (for the Unix <em class="emphasis">mail</em></tt> program).
</p>

<p>
Your <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt>, together with the environment file
that we discuss towards the end of this chapter,
will be the source of practically all
of the customizations we discuss here as well
as in subsequent chapters.
Therefore, it is very
important for you to become comfortable with a text editor
like <em class="emphasis">vi</em></tt> or Emacs so that you can try whatever
customization techniques strike your fancy.
</p>

<?troff .Nd 10?>

<p>
Bear in mind, however, that if you add commands to your <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt>,
they will not take effect until you
log out and log back in again, or type the command <tt class="literal">login</tt>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-34">[34]</a>
Of course, you need not immediately add customization
commands to your <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> -- you can always just test
them by typing them in yourself.
(Be sure you test your changes though:  it is possible to set things up
in your <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> such that you can't log back in!
Test your changes before logging out, by logging in again, perhaps from
a new window or virtual console.)
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-34" /><p> [34]
This has the same effect as logging out and logging in again,
although it actually replaces your login session with a new one
without explicitly terminating the old session.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you already have a <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt>, it's likely to contain
lines similar to some of these:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">
PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/ucb:/local/bin:
stty stop ^S intr ^C erase ^?
EDITOR=/usr/local/bin/emacs
SHELL=/bin/ksh
export EDITOR
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
These commands set up a basic environment for you, so
you probably shouldn't change them until you learn about
what they do -- which you will by the end of this chapter.
When you edit your <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt>, just put your additional
lines in afterwards.

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.1. The /etc/profile File</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-3-287327" />

Every user has a personal <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> file in the
home directory.  While your system administrator may have provided you with
an initial <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> file when your account was first set
up, you are free to customize it as you see fit.
</p>

<p>
There is an additional, system-wide, customization file known as
<em class="emphasis">/etc/profile</em></tt>.  If this file exists, the Korn shell
reads and executes it as the very first thing it does, even before
reading your personal <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> file.
This is where your system administrator places commands that should be
executed by <em class="emphasis">every</em></tt> user upon login, and where
he or she places system-wide defaults, such as adding extra directories
to the <tt class="literal">PATH</tt> variable
(which, as you will see later in this chapter, tells the shell where to
look for programs to run).
</p>

<p>
It pays to be aware of this file, since it may have settings in it that
you might wish to override in your own <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt> file.
(At least, once you understand what it's doing!)
If the file exists, it will be readable and will contain shell commands in it,
just like your <em class="emphasis">.profile</em></tt>.  It may be worthwhile to peruse the version
on your system; you may learn something that way.
