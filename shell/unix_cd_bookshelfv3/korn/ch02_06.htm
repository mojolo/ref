<h2 class="sect1">2.6. Finger Habits</h2>

<p>
<a name="IXT-2-287316" />

To paraphrase the old adage, old finger habits die hard.
In fact, that is the primary reason for the choices of <em class="emphasis">vi</em> and
Emacs for the Korn shell's editing modes.
If you are an experienced
user of one of these editors, by all means use the corresponding
Korn shell editing mode.

If you are a <em class="emphasis">vi</em> wizard, you probably
know how to navigate between any two points on a line in three
keystrokes or less.
</p>

But if you're not, you should seriously consider adopting
emacs-mode finger habits. Because it is based on control keys,
just like the minimal editing support you may have already used
with the Bourne or C shell, you will find emacs-mode easier to assimilate.

Although the full Emacs is an extremely powerful
editor, its command structure lends itself very well to small
subsetting: there are several "mini-emacs" style editors
floating around for Unix, MS-DOS, and other systems.

</p>

<p>
The same cannot be said for <em class="emphasis">vi</em>, because its command structure
is really meant for use in a full-screen editor. <em class="emphasis">vi</em> is quite
powerful too, in its way, but its power becomes evident only when
it is used for purposes similar to that for which it was designed: editing
source code in C and LISP.
Doing complicated things in <em class="emphasis">vi</em> takes relatively few keystrokes.
But doing simple things takes more keystrokes in vi-mode than it does in emacs-mode.
Unfortunately, the ability to do simple things with a minimal
number of keystrokes
is most desired in a command interpreter, especially nowadays
when users are spending more time within applications and less
time working with the shell.
</p>

<p>
Both Korn shell editing modes have quite a few commands; you will
undoubtedly develop finger habits that include just a few of them.

If you use emacs-mode and you aren't familiar
with the full Emacs,
here is a subset that is easy to learn yet enables you
to do just about anything:
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>
For cursor motion around a command line, stick to CTRL-A and CTRL-E for
beginning and end of line, and CTRL-F and CTRL-B for moving around.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Delete using DEL (or whatever your "erase" key is) and CTRL-D; as with
CTRL-F and CTRL-B, hold down to repeat if necessary. Use CTRL-C to erase the
entire line.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Use CTRL-P to retrieve the last command when you make a mistake.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Use CTRL-R to search for a command you need to run again.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Definitely use TAB for filename, command, and variable completion.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
After a few hours spent learning these finger habits, you will
wonder how you ever got along without command-line editing.
