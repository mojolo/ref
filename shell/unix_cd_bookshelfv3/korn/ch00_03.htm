<h2 class="sect1">0.3. Intended Audience</h2>

<p>
This book is designed to appeal most to casual Unix
users who are just above the "raw beginner" level. You should
be familiar with the process of logging in, entering commands,
and doing simple things with files.
Although <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1</a> reviews
concepts such as the tree-like file and directory
scheme, you may find that it moves too quickly if you're a
complete neophyte. In that case, we recommend the book
<em class="citetitle">Learning the Unix Operating System</em> by
Jerry Peek, Grace Todino, and John Strang, published by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.
</p>

<p>
If you're an experienced user, you may wish
to skip <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1</a> altogether.
But if your experience is with the C shell, you
may find that <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1</a> reveals a few subtle differences
between the Korn and C shells.
</p>

<p>
No matter what your level of experience, you will undoubtedly
learn many things in this book that will make you a more productive
Korn shell user -- from major features down to details at the
"nook-and-cranny" level that you weren't aware of.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in shell programming
(writing shell scripts and functions that
automate everyday tasks or serve as system utilities),
you should find this book useful too.
However, we have deliberately avoided drawing a strong
distinction<?troff .ne 10?>
between interactive shell use (entering commands during a login
session) and shell programming.
We see shell programming as a natural, inevitable outgrowth
of increasing experience as a user.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, each chapter
depends on those prior to it, and although the first three
chapters are oriented toward interactive use only, subsequent
chapters describe interactive user-oriented features in addition
to programming concepts.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if this book has an overriding message, it is this:
"The Korn shell is an incredibly powerful and grossly undervalued
Unix programming environment. You -- yes, <em class="emphasis">you</em> -- can write
useful shell programs, even if you just learned how to log on
last week and have never programmed before."
</p>

<p>
Toward that end, we have decided not to spend much time on
features of interest exclusively to low-level systems programmers.
Concepts like file descriptors,

special file types, etc., can only confuse the casual user,
and anyway, we figure that those of you who understand such
things are smart enough to extrapolate the necessary information
from our cursory discussions.
