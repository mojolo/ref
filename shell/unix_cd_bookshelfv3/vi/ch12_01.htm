It started out as a copy of Version 3.9 of MicroEMACS
that was modified to have the "finger feel" of <em class="emphasis">vi</em>.
There are currently three maintainers: Paul Fox, Tom Dickey,
<a name="IXT-12-281950" />
<a name="IXT-12-281951" />
<a name="IXT-12-281952" />
and Kevin Buettner.
The current version is 8.0; it is essentially the same as 7.4, but
with bug fixes.
This chapter was written using <em class="emphasis">vile</em>.

<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />12.1. Authors and History</h2>

<p>Paul Fox describes the early <em class="emphasis">vile</em> history
this way:</p>


<p><em class="emphasis">vile</em>'s design goal has always been a little
different than that of the
other clones.
<em class="emphasis">vile</em> has never <em class="emphasis">really</em> attempted
to be a "clone" at
all, though most people find it close enough. I started it because in
1990 I wanted to to be able to edit multiple files in multiple windows,
I had been using <em class="emphasis">vi</em> for 10 years already, and the sources to
Micro-EMACS came floating past my newsreader at a job where I had too
much time on my hands. I started by changing the existing keymaps in
the obvious way, and ran full-tilt into
the "Hey! Where's 'insert'
mode?" problem. So I hacked a little more, and hacked a little more,
and eventually released in '91 or '92.
(Starting soon thereafter,
major version numbers tracked the year of release: 7.3 was the third
release in '97.)</p>

<?troff .Nd 10?><p>But my goal has always been to preserve finger-feel (as opposed to the
display visuals), and, selfishly, to preserve finger-feel most for the
commands I use.  <img src="figs/ct.smiley.gif" alt="Figure " />  <em class="emphasis">vile</em> has quite an
amazing <em class="emphasis">ex</em> mode, that
works very well&#8212;it just <em class="emphasis">looks</em> really odd,
and a couple of commands
which are beyond the scope of the current parser are missing. For the
same reasons, <em class="emphasis">vile</em> also won't fully parse
existing <em class="filename">.exrc</em> files, since I
don't really think that's so important&#8212;it does simple ones,
but more sophisticated ones need some tweaking.
But when you toss in <em class="emphasis">vile</em>'s
built-in command/macro language, you quickly forget you ever cared
about <em class="filename">.exrc</em>.</p>


<p>Tom Dickey started working on <em class="emphasis">vile</em> in December of 1992,
initially just contributing patches, and later doing more
significant features and extensions, such as line numbering,
name completion, and animating the buffer list window.
Tom states that "Integrating features together is more important
to my design goals than implementing a large number of features."</p>

<p>In February of 1994, Kevin Buettner started working on <em class="emphasis">vile</em>.
Initially, he supplied bug fixes for the X11 version,
<em class="emphasis">xvile</em>, and then improvements, such as scrollbars.
This evolved into support for the Motif, OpenLook, and Athena
widget sets. Because, surprisingly, the Athena widgets were
not "universally available in a bugfree form," he wrote a
version that used the raw <em class="emphasis">Xt</em> toolkit.
This version ended up providing superior functionality to the
Athena version.
Kevin also contributed the initial support in <em class="emphasis">vile</em> for
GNU Autoconf.</p>

<p>Currently, <em class="emphasis">vile</em> maintenance is done "by committee,"
with Tom Dickey being the primary maintainer.
Paul manages the mailing lists.</p>

<p>For the near term, future work will focus on improving the Perl
integration, and enhancing the major mode concept (discussed below).</p>
