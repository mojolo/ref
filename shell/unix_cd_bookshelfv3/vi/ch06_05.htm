<h2 class="sect1">6.5. A Final Look at Pattern Matching </h2>

<p>We conclude this chapter by presenting sample tasks that involve
complex pattern-matching concepts.
Rather than solve the problems right away, we'll work toward
the solutions step by step.</p>

<a name="vi6-ch-6-sect-4.4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.1. Deleting an Unknown Block of Text</h3>

<p>Suppose you have a few lines with this general form:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">the best of times; the worst of times:  moving
The coolest of times; the worst of times:  moving</pre></blockquote>

<p>The lines that you're concerned with always end
with <em class="emphasis">moving</em>, but you never know what the first two words
might be. You want to change
any line that ends with <em class="emphasis">moving</em> to read:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">The greatest of times; the worst of times:  moving</pre></blockquote>

<p>Since the changes must occur on certain lines, you need to
specify a context-sensitive global replacement. Using
<tt class="literal">:g/moving$/</tt> will match lines that end with <em class="emphasis">moving</em>.
Next, you realize that your search pattern could be any number of
any character, so the metacharacters <tt class="literal">.*</tt> come to mind.
But these will match the whole line unless you somehow restrict
the match. Here's your first attempt:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:g/moving$/s/.*of/The<img src="figs/squ.gif" alt="Figure " />greatest<img src="figs/squ.gif" alt="Figure " />of/</pre></blockquote>

<p>This search string, you decide, will match from the beginning of
the line to the first <em class="emphasis">of</em>.  Since you needed to specify the
word <em class="emphasis">of</em> to restrict the search, you simply repeat it in the
replacement. Here's the resulting line:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">The greatest of times:  moving</pre></blockquote>

<p>Something went wrong. The replacement gobbled the line up to the second
<em class="emphasis">of</em> instead of the first. Here's why. When given a
choice, the action of "match any number of any character" will
match as much text as possible.
In this case, since the word <em class="emphasis">of</em> appears twice,
your search string finds:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">the best of times; the worst of</pre></blockquote>

<p>rather than:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">the best of</pre></blockquote>

<p>Your search pattern needs to be more restrictive:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:g/moving$/s/.*of times;/The greatest of times;/</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now the <tt class="literal">.*</tt> will match all characters up to
the instance of the phrase <em class="emphasis">of times;</em>.
Since there's only one instance, it has to be the first.</p>

<p>There are cases, though, when it is
inconvenient, or even incorrect, to use the <tt class="literal">.*</tt> metacharacters.
For example, you might find yourself typing
many words to restrict your search pattern, or you might
be unable to restrict the pattern by specific words (if the text
in the lines varies widely). The next section presents such a
case.</p>
</div>




<a name="vi6-ch-6-sect-4.4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.2. Switching Items in a Database</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-6-280190" />
<a name="IXT-6-280191" />
<a name="IXT-6-280192" />
<a name="IXT-6-280193" />
Suppose you want to switch the order of all last names
and first names in a (text) database.
The lines look like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Name: Feld, Ray; Areas: PC, UNIX; Phone: 123-4567
Name: Joy, Susan S.; Areas: Graphics; Phone: 999-3333</pre></blockquote>

<p>The name of each field ends with a colon, and each field is
separated by a semicolon. Using the top line as an example, you
want to change <em class="emphasis">Feld, Ray</em> to <em class="emphasis">Ray Feld</em>.
We'll present some commands that look promising but don't work.
After each command, we show you the line the way it looked before
the change and after the change.</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:%s/: \(.*\), \(.*\);/: \2 \1;/

Name: <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld, Ray; Areas: PC</b>, <em class="emphasis">UNIX</em>; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">Before</i>
Name: <em class="emphasis">UNIX</em> <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld, Ray; Areas: PC</b>; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">After</i></pre></blockquote>

<p>We've highlighted the contents of the first hold buffer in
<tt class="userinput"><b>bold</b></tt>
and the contents of the second hold buffer in <em class="replaceable"><tt>italic</tt></em>.
Note that the first hold buffer contains more than you want.
Since it was not sufficiently restricted by the pattern that
follows it, the hold buffer was able to save up to the second comma.
Now you try to restrict the contents of the first hold buffer:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:%s/: \(....\), \(.*\);/: \2 \1;/

Name: <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld</b>, <em class="emphasis">Ray; Areas: PC, UNIX</em>; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">Before</i>
Name: <em class="emphasis">Ray; Areas: PC, UNIX</em> <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld</b>; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">After</i></pre></blockquote>

<p>Here you've managed to save the last name in the first hold
buffer, but now the second hold buffer will save anything
up to the last semicolon on the line. Now you restrict the
second hold buffer, too:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:%s/: \(....\), \(...\);/: \2 \1;/

Name: <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld</b>, <em class="emphasis">Ray</em>; Areas: PC, UNIX; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">Before</i>
Name: <em class="emphasis">Ray</em> <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld</b>; Areas: PC, UNIX; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">After</i></pre></blockquote>

<p>This gives you what you want, but only in the specific case of a
four-letter last name and a three-letter first name. (The
previous attempt included the same mistake.) Why not just return
to the first attempt, but this time be more selective about the
end of the search pattern?</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:%s/: \(.*\), \(.*\); Area/: \2 \1; Area/

Name: <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld</b>, <em class="emphasis">Ray</em>; Areas: PC, UNIX; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">Before</i>
Name: <em class="emphasis">Ray</em> <b class="emphasis-bold">Feld</b>; Areas: PC, UNIX; Phone: 123-4567	<i class="lineannotation">After</i></pre></blockquote>

<p>This works, but we'll continue the discussion by
introducing an additional concern. Suppose that the <em class="emphasis">Area</em>
field isn't always present or isn't always the second field.
The above command won't work on such lines.</p>

<p>We introduce this problem to make a point. Whenever you rethink
a pattern match, it's usually better to work toward refining the
variables (the metacharacters), rather than using specific text
to restrict patterns. The more variables you use in your
patterns,
the more powerful your commands will be.</p>

<p>In the current example,
think again about the patterns you want to switch.
Each word starts with an uppercase letter and is followed by any
number of lowercase letters, so you can match the names like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[A-Z][a-z]*</pre></blockquote>

<p>A last name might also have more than one uppercase letter
(<em class="emphasis">McFly</em>, for example),
so you'd want to search for this possibility in the second and
succeeding letters:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[A-Z][A-Za-z]*</pre></blockquote>

<p>It doesn't hurt to use this for the first name, too (you never
know when <em class="emphasis">McGeorge Bundy</em> will turn up).
Your command now becomes:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:%s/: \([A-Z][A-Za-z]*\), \([A-Z][A-Za-z]*\);/: \2 \1;/</pre></blockquote>

<p>Quite forbidding, isn't it?
It still doesn't cover the case of a name like <em class="emphasis">Joy, Susan S.</em>
Since the first-name field might include a middle initial, you need to
add a space and a period within the second pair of brackets.
But enough is enough.
Sometimes, specifying exactly what
you want is more difficult than specifying what you <em class="emphasis">don't</em>
want. In your sample database, the last names end with a comma,
so a last-name field can be thought of as a string of characters
that are <em class="emphasis">not</em> commas:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[^,]*</pre></blockquote>

<p>This pattern matches characters up until the first comma.
Similarly, the first-name field is a string of characters that
are <em class="emphasis">not</em> semicolons:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[^;]*</pre></blockquote>

<p>Putting these more efficient patterns back into your previous
command, you get:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:%s/: \([^,]*\), \([^;]*\);/: \2 \1;/</pre></blockquote>


<?troff .Nd 10?><p>The same command could also be entered as a
context-sensitive replacement.
If all lines begin with <em class="emphasis">Name</em>, you can say:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:g/^Name/s/: \([^,]*\), \([^;]*\);/: \2 \1;/</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can also add an asterisk after the first space,
in order to match a colon that has extra spaces (or no spaces)
after it:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:g/^Name/s/: *\([^,]*\), \([^;]*\);/: \2 \1;/</pre></blockquote>

<a name="vi6-ch-6-sect-4.4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.3. Using :g to Repeat a Command </h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-6-280194" />
<a name="IXT-6-280195" />
As we've usually seen the <tt class="literal">:g</tt> command used, it selects lines that
are typically then edited by subsequent commands on the same line&#8212;for
example, we select lines with <tt class="literal">g</tt>, and then make substitutions
on them, or select them and delete them:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:g/mg[ira]box/s/box/square/g
:g/^$/d</pre></blockquote>

<p>However, in his two-part tutorial in <em class="citetitle">UNIX World</em>,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-26">[26]</a>
<a name="IXT-6-280196" />
Walter Zintz makes an interesting point about the <tt class="literal">g</tt>
command. This command selects lines&#8212;but the associated editing
commands need not actually affect the lines that are selected.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-26" /><p> [26]Part 1, "<i class="command">vi</i> Tips for Power Users," appears in the April 1990
issue of <em class="citetitle">UNIX World</em>.  Part&#160;2, "Using <i class="command">vi</i> to Automate
Complex Edits," appears in the May 1990 issue.
The examples presented are from Part&#160;2.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Instead, he demonstrates a technique by which you can repeat
<i class="command">ex</i> commands
some arbitrary number of times. For example, suppose you want to place
ten copies of lines 12 through 17 of your file at the end of your
current file. You could type:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:1,10g/^/ 12,17t$</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is a very unexpected use of <tt class="literal">g</tt>, but it works! The
<tt class="literal">g</tt> command
selects line 1, executes the specified <tt class="literal">t</tt> command, then goes on to
line&#160;2, to execute the next copy command. When line 10 is
reached, <i class="command">ex</i> will have made ten copies.</p>
</div>




<a name="vi6-ch-6-sect-4.4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.4. Collecting Lines</h3>

<p>
<a name="IXT-6-280197" />
<a name="IXT-6-280198" />
Here's another advanced <tt class="literal">g</tt> example, again building on
suggestions provided in Zintz's article.
Suppose you're editing a document that consists of several parts.
Part&#160;2 of this file is shown below, using ellipses to
show omitted text and displaying line numbers for reference:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">301  Part 2
302  Capability Reference
303  .LP
304  Chapter 7
305  Introduction to the Capabilities
<b class="emphasis-bold">306  This and the next three chapters ...</b>

400  ... and a complete index at the end.
401  .LP
402  Chapter 8
403  Screen Dimensions
<b class="emphasis-bold">404  Before you can do anything useful</b>
405  on the screen, you need to know ...

555  .LP
556  Chapter 9
557  Editing the Screen
<b class="emphasis-bold">558  This chapter discusses ...</b>

821  .LP
822  Part 3:
823  Advanced Features
824  .LP
825  Chapter 10</pre></blockquote>

<p>The chapter numbers appear on one line, their
titles appear on the line below, and the chapter text
(highlighted for emphasis)
begins on the line below that.
The first thing you'd like to do is copy the beginning line
of each chapter, sending it to an already existing file called
<em class="filename">begin</em>.</p>

<p>Here's the command that does this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:g /^Chapter/ .+2w &gt;&gt; begin</pre></blockquote>

<p>You must be at the top of your file before issuing this command.
First you search for <em class="emphasis">Chapter</em> at the start of a line,
but then you want to run the command on the beginning line of each
chapter&#8212;the second line below <em class="emphasis">Chapter</em>.
Because a line beginning with <em class="emphasis">Chapter</em> is now selected as
the current line,
the line address <tt class="literal">.+2</tt> will indicate the second line below it.
The equivalent line
addresses <tt class="literal">+2</tt> or <tt class="literal">++</tt> work as well.
You want to write these lines to an existing file named
<em class="filename">begin</em>, so you issue the <tt class="literal">w</tt> command with the append operator
<tt class="literal">&gt;&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to send the beginnings of chapters that are only
within Part 2. You need to restrict the lines selected by <tt class="literal">g</tt>,
so you change your command to this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:/^Part 2/,/^Part 3/g /^Chapter/ .+2w &gt;&gt; begin</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here, the <tt class="literal">g</tt> command selects the lines that begin with
<em class="emphasis">Chapter</em>, but it searches
only that portion of the file from a line
starting with <em class="emphasis">Part 2</em> through a line
starting with <em class="emphasis">Part 3</em>.
If you issue the above command,
the last lines of the file <em class="filename">begin</em> will read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">This and the next three chapters ...
Before you can do anything useful
This chapter discusses ...</pre></blockquote>

<p>These are the lines that begin Chapters 7, 8, and 9.</p>

<p>In addition to the lines you've just sent,
you'd like to copy chapter titles to the end of
the document, in preparation for making a table of contents.
You can use the vertical bar to tack a second command after
your first command, like so:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">:/^Part 2/,/^Part 3/g /^Chapter/ .+2w &gt;&gt; begin | +t$</pre></blockquote>

<p>Remember that with any subsequent command, line addresses are
relative to the previous command. The first command has marked
lines
(within Part 2) that start with <em class="emphasis">Chapter</em>, and the chapter titles
appear on a line below such lines. Therefore,
to access chapter titles in the second command, the line
address is <tt class="literal">+</tt> (or the equivalents <tt class="literal">+1</tt> or <tt class="literal">.+1</tt>).
Then use <tt class="literal">t$</tt> to copy the chapter titles to the end of the
file.</p>

<p>As these examples illustrate, thought and
experimentation may lead you to some unusual editing solutions.
Don't be afraid to try things! Just be sure to back up your file
first!</p>
