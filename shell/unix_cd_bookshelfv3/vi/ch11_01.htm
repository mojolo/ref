It was written by Bram Moolenaar, who continues to maintain it.
Today, <em class="emphasis">vim</em> is perhaps the most widely used
<em class="emphasis">vi</em> clone, and there exists a separate
Internet domain (vim.org)
dedicated to it.
Various versions of <em class="emphasis">vim</em> were used for most
of the work updating this book; much of the later work was
done with Version 5.0.
Version 5.1 became current as the updates were finishing; this
is mostly a bug fix release.</p><a name="IXT-11-281949" /><div class="sect1"><a name="vi6-ch-11-sect-1" />
<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />11.1. Author and History</h2>

<p>This section is adapted from material supplied by
Bram Moolenaar, <em class="emphasis">vim</em>'s author.
We thank him.</p>

<p>Work on <em class="emphasis">vim</em> started when the
author bought an Amiga computer. Coming from the
UNIX world, he started using a <em class="emphasis">vi</em>-like editor
<a name="IXT-11-281639" />
called <em class="emphasis">stevie</em>.  But it was far
from perfect. Fortunately, it came with the source code. This is where
work on <em class="emphasis">vim</em> started.
At first it was a matter of making the editor more <em class="emphasis">vi</em>
compatible and fixing bugs. After a while the program became very usable, and
<em class="emphasis">vim</em> Version 1.14 was published on
Fred Fish disk 591 (a collection of free
software for the Amiga).</p>

<p>Other people began to use the program, liked it, and started helping
development. A port to UNIX was done, then later to MS-DOS and other systems.
<em class="emphasis">vim</em>
became one of the most widely available <em class="emphasis">vi</em> clones.
More features were added gradually:
multi-level undo, multiwindowing, etc. Some features were
unique to <em class="emphasis">vim</em>, but many were inspired by other
<em class="emphasis">vi</em> clones. The goal
has always been to provide the best for the user.</p>

<p>Today <em class="emphasis">vim</em> is one of the most full-featured of the
<em class="emphasis">vi</em>-style editors anywhere. The online help
is extensive. (It is described in more detail below.)</p>

<p>One of the more obscure features of <em class="emphasis">vim</em>
is to be able to type from right to
left. This is useful for languages like Hebrew and Farsi. This illustrates
<em class="emphasis">vim</em>'s versatility.
In Version 5.0 the <em class="emphasis">vi</em> compatibility was also
improved, and the performance was further tuned. Being a rock-stable editor,
on which professional software developers can rely,
is another of <em class="emphasis">vim</em>'s design goals.
Crashing with <em class="emphasis">vim</em> is rare,
and when it happens you can recover your changes.</p>

<p>The development on <em class="emphasis">vim</em> continues.
Plans for <em class="emphasis">vim</em> 6.0 include support for
folding (being able to hide part of the text, e.g., the body of a
function). The group of people helping to add features
and port <em class="emphasis">vim</em> to more
platforms is growing. The quality of the ports to different computer systems
is increasing. The MS-Windows version will get dialogues and a file-selector.
This opens up the hard-to-learn <em class="emphasis">vi</em> commands
to a large group of users.</p>
