<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1><p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics, breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p><p>The animal featured on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Learning the vi Editor</em> is a tarsier, a nocturnal mammal related to the lemur. Its generic name, Tarsius, is derived from the animal's very long ankle bone, the tarsus. The tarsier is a native of the East Indies jungles from Sumatra to the Philippines and Sulawesi, where it lives in the trees, leaping from branch to branch with extreme agility and speed.</p><p>A small animal, the tarsier's body is only six inches long, followed by a ten inch tufted tail. It is covered in soft, brown or grey silky fur, has a round face, and huge eyes. Its arms and legs are long and slender as are its digits which are tipped with rounded, fleshy pads to improve the tarsier's grip on trees. Tarsiers are active only at night, hiding during the day in tangles of vines or in the tops of tall trees. They subsist mainly on insects, and, though very curious animals, tend to be loners.</p><p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a 19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover layout was produced by Kathleen Wilson, using QuarkXPress 3.32 with ITC Garamond font from Adobe.</p><p>Nicole Gipson Arigo was the production editor and project manager. Jane Ellin proofread the book. Claire Cloutier LeBlanc, Madeleine Newell, Melanie Wang, and Sheryl Avruch provided quality control reviews. Seth Maislin wrote the index, and Robert Romano created the illustrations in Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and Macromedia Freehand 7.0. The inside layout was designed by Edie Freedman and Nancy Priest and was formatted in SGML by Len Muellner and Chris Maden, using ITC Garamond Light and ITC Garamond Book fonts. This colophon was written by Michael Kalantarian.</p><p>The online edition of this book was created by the Safari
production group (John Chodacki, Becki Maisch, and Madeleine Newell)
using a set of Frame-to-XML conversion and cleanup tools written and
maintained by Erik Ray, Benn Salter, John Chodacki, and Jeff
Liggett.</p>
