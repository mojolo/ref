<h2 class="sect1">45.10. Introduction to Typesetting</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-45-1807" /><a name="IXT-45-1808" />Once
upon a time, printers were simple. You hooked them up to your machine
and dumped text out to them, and they printed the text. Nothing
fancy, and not very pretty either. As printers got smarter, they
became capable of more things, printing in a different font, perhaps.
Printing got a bit more complex. If you wanted to use fancy features,
you had to embed special characters in your text, specific to the
printer.
</p>

<p>Printers got even smarter, and could draw pictures, print images, and
use all sorts of fonts. They started <b class="emphasis-bold">using
complex languages</b> (<a href="ch45_14.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-14">Section 45.14</a>) to print,
which made dealing with them more complex but at least somewhat more
consistent. People wrote <b class="emphasis-bold">tools to convert
text</b> (<a href="ch45_07.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-7">Section 45.7</a>) so it could be
printed.
</p>

<p>Webster defines typesetting as "the process of
setting material in type or into a form to be used in
printing," literally, the setting of type into a
printing press. As computers have gotten more sophisticated, it has
come to include the formatting of text and images to send to
typesetting machines and then, later, smart printers. These days,
your average printer is pretty smart and can handle everything the
typesetters of old could do and more.
<a name="IXT-45-1809" />Windows systems provide What
You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG, pronounced whiz-ee-wig) editors as
a matter of course, most of which do all of their typesetting without
any user intervention (and often badly, to boot).
</p>

<p>On Unix, typesetting generally involves describing the formatting you
want using a formatting language and then processing the source file
to generate something that a printer can understand. There are a
variety of tools and languages that do this, with various purposes,
strengths, and weaknesses. Many formatting languages are markup
languages, that is, they introduce formatting information by
"marking up" the text you want
formatted.
</p>

<p>There is an entire science (and art) of typography that we
won't try to get into here. My personal favorite
books on the subject are Robert Bringhurst's
<em class="citetitle">The Elements of Typographic Style</em> for general
typography and Donald Knuth's <em class="citetitle">Digital
Typography</em> for issues of typesetting with computers.
</p>

<p>What we will try to cover are formatting languages (<a href="ch45_12.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-12">Section 45.12</a> and <a href="ch45_13.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-13">Section 45.13</a>), printer
languages (<a href="ch45_14.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-14">Section 45.14</a>), and ways to use
Unix to get those formatting languages out to your printer usefully
(<a href="ch45_15.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-15">Section 45.15</a> through <a href="ch45_17.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-17">Section 45.17</a>). 
</p>

<p>Relatively recently, open source WYSIWYG tools have become available
for Unix. OpenOffice, available at <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">http://www.openoffice.org</a>, is a good example.
OpenOffice does its own typesetting behind the scenes and dumps out
PostScript. If you don't have a PostScript printer
and you're interested in using something like
OpenOffice, <a href="ch45_18.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-18">Section 45.18</a> might help.
