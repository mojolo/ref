<h2 class="sect1">6.3. X Resource Syntax</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1124" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1125" /><a name="IXT-6-860" />Virtually all X Window System
clients are customizable.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-25">[25]</a> You can specify how a client looks on the
screen -- its size and placement, its border and background color
or pattern, whether the window has a scrollbar, and so on. This
article introduces X resources and shows their syntax.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-25" /><p> [25]Not to be confused with the
extensive customization of window decorations and the like now
possible with window managers such as Enlightenment, Afterstep, FVWM,
or Sawfish. If you have a difficult time visualizing what is affected
by these resource assignments apart from the fancy decoration around
the windows themselves, try killing your window manager and viewing
just the X clients themselves, in all of their sparse glory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Traditional Unix applications rely on command-line options to allow
users to customize the way they work. X applications support
command-line options too, but often not for all features. Almost
every feature of an X program can be controlled by a variable called
a <a name="IXT-6-861" /><em class="emphasis">resource</em>;
you can change the behavior or appearance of a program by changing
the <em class="emphasis">value</em> associated with a resource variable.
</p>

<p>Resource variables may be Boolean (such as <tt class="literal">scrollBar:
True</tt>) or take a numeric or string value
(<tt class="literal">borderWidth: 2</tt> or <tt class="literal">foreground:
blue</tt>). What's more, in applications
written with the X Toolkit (or an Xt-based toolkit such as the Motif
toolkit), resources may be associated with separate
<em class="emphasis">objects</em><a name="IXT-6-862" /> (or
"widgets") within an application.
There is a syntax that allows for separate control over both a
<em class="emphasis">class</em><a name="IXT-6-863" /><a name="IXT-6-864" /> of objects in the application
and an individual <em class="emphasis">instance</em> of an object. This is
illustrated by these resource specifications for a hypothetical
application called <i class="command">xclient</i>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">xclient*Buttons.foreground:     blue
xclient*help.foreground:        red</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first resource specification makes the foreground color blue for
all buttons in the <i class="command">xclient</i> application (in the
class <tt class="literal">Buttons</tt>); the second resource specification
makes the foreground color red for the <tt class="literal">help</tt> button
in this application (an instance of the class
<tt class="literal">Buttons</tt>). Resource settings can be even simpler
than this.
</p>

<p>The values of resources can be set as application defaults using a
number of different mechanisms, including resource files in your home
directory and a program called <i class="command">xrdb</i> (X resource
database manager). As we'll see, the
<i class="command">xrdb</i> program stores resources directly in the X
server, making them available to all clients, regardless of the
machine on which the clients run.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-26">[26]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-26" /><p> [26]Remember, in X the
client server model is the inverse of what you may be used to; the
server is local, and displays clients that may be running
remotely.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Placing resources in files allows you to set many resources at once
without the restrictions encountered when using command-line options.
<a name="IXT-6-865" /><a name="IXT-6-866" /><a name="IXT-6-867" />In addition to a primary resource file
(often called <em class="filename">.Xdefaults</em>,
<em class="filename">.Xresources</em>, or <em class="filename">xrdb</em>) in
your home directory, which determines defaults for the clients you
yourself run, the system administrator can create system-wide
resource files to set defaults for all instances of the application
run on this machine. It is also possible to create resource files to
set some resources for just the local machine, some for all machines
in a network, and some for one or more specific machines.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-27">[27]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-27" /><p> [27]While this is often okay for applications such as
<em class="filename">xterm</em> that have not been modified much since the
early nineties, app-defaults files can be more trouble than
they're worth in a rapid application development
environment, as they can quickly get out of sync with changes in the
application itself from one version to the next.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The various resource files are automatically read in and processed in
a certain order
<a name="IXT-6-868" />within an application by a set of
routines called the <em class="emphasis">resource manager</em>. The syntax
for resource specifications and the rules of precedence by which the
resource manager processes them are intended to give you the maximum
flexibility in setting resources with the minimum amount of text. You
can specify a resource that controls only one feature of a single
application, such as the red <tt class="literal">help</tt> button in the
hypothetical <i class="command">xclient</i> settings listed earlier. You
can also specify a resource that controls one feature of multiple
objects within multiple applications with a single line.
</p>

<p>Command-line options normally take precedence over any prior resource
settings; so you can set up the files to control the way you
<em class="emphasis">normally</em> want your application to work and then
use command-line options (in an <b class="emphasis-bold">alias or shell
function</b> (<a href="ch29_01.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-1">Section 29.1</a>), for instance) to
specify changes you need for only one or two instances of the
application.
</p>

<p>The basic syntax of a resource definition file is fairly simple. Each
client recognizes certain resource variables that can be assigned a
value; see the client's manpage for a list.
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Toolkits</em> are a <a name="IXT-6-869" /> <a name="IXT-6-870" />mechanism for simplifying the design and
coding of applications and making them operate in a consistent way.
Toolkits provide a standard set of objects or widgets, such as menus,
command buttons, dialog boxes, scrollbars, and so on. If a client was
built with the X Toolkit, this should be noted on its manual page. In
addition to certain application-specific resource variables, most
clients that use the X Toolkit recognize a common set of resource
variables.
</p>

<p>The most basic line you can have in a resource definition file
consists of the name of a client, followed by a dot (.) or an
asterisk (<tt class="literal">*</tt>), and the name of a variable. A colon
(:) and whitespace separate the client and variable names from the
actual value of the resource variable. The following line gives a
scrollbar to all instances of the <i class="command">xterm</i> client:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">xterm*scrollBar:        True</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the name of the client is omitted, the variable is
<em class="emphasis">global</em>: it applies to all instances of all
clients (in this case, all clients that can have a scrollbar). If the
same variable is specified as a global variable and a client-specific
variable, the value of the client-specific variable takes precedence
for that client. However, if the name of the client is omitted, the
line should generally begin with an asterisk.
</p>

<p>Be sure not to omit the colon inadvertently at the end of a resource
specification. This is an easy mistake to make, and the resource
manager provides no error messages. If there is an error in a
resource specification (including a syntax error such as the omission
of the colon or a misspelling), the specification is ignored. The
value you set will simply not take effect.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-6-871" />A line starting with an
<a name="IXT-6-872" />exclamation point
(<tt class="literal">!</tt>) is ignored as a comment. If the last character
on a line is a <a name="IXT-6-873" />backslash (<tt class="literal">\</tt>),
the resource definition on that line is assumed to continue on the
next line.<a name="IXTR3-964" /> <a name="IXTR3-965" /> 
</p>
