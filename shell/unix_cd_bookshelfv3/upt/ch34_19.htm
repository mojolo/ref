<h2 class="sect1">34.19. Multiline Delete</h2>

<p>The <i class="command">sed</i><a name="IXT-34-791" /><a name="IXT-34-792" /> <a name="IXT-34-793" /> delete command,
<em class="emphasis">d</em>, deletes the contents of the <b class="emphasis-bold">pattern space</b> (<a name="IXT-34-794" /><a href="ch34_14.htm#upt3-CHP-34-SECT-14">Section 34.14</a>) and
causes a new line of input to be read, with editing resuming at the
top of the script. The Delete command, <em class="emphasis">D</em>, works
slightly differently: it deletes a portion of the
<a name="IXT-34-795" />pattern space, up to the first
embedded newline. It does not cause a new line of input to be read;
instead, it returns to the top of the script, applying these
instructions to what remains in the pattern space. We can see the
difference by writing a script that looks for a series of blank lines
and outputs a single blank line. The version below uses the delete
command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># reduce multiple blank lines to one; version using d command
/^$/{
   N
   /^\n$/d
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>When a blank line is encountered, the next line is appended to the
pattern space. Then we try to match the embedded newline. Note that
the positional metacharacters, <tt class="literal">^</tt> and
<tt class="literal">$</tt>, match the beginning and the end of the pattern
space, respectively. Here's a test file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">This line is followed by 1 blank line.

This line is followed by 2 blank lines.


This line is followed by 3 blank lines.



This line is followed by 4 blank lines.




This is the end.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Running the script on the test file produces the following result:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>sed -f sed.blank test.blank</b></tt>
This line is followed by 1 blank line.

This line is followed by 2 blank lines.
This line is followed by 3 blank lines.

This line is followed by 4 blank lines.
This is the end.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Where there was an even number of blank lines, all the blank lines
were removed. Only when there was an odd number of blank lines was a
single blank line preserved. That is because the delete command
clears the entire pattern space. Once the first blank line is
encountered, the next line is read in, and both are deleted. If a
third blank line is encountered, and the next line is not blank, the
delete command is not applied, and thus a blank line is output. If we
use the multiline Delete command, <tt class="literal">/^\n$/D</tt>, we get
a different result, and the one that we wanted.
</p>

<p>The reason the multiline Delete command gets the job done is that
when we encounter two blank lines, the Delete command removes only
the first of the two. The next time through the script, the blank
line will cause another line to be read into the pattern space. If
that line is not blank, both lines are output, thus ensuring that a
single blank line will be output. In other words, when there are two
blank lines in the pattern space, only the first is deleted. When a
blank line is followed by text, the pattern space is output normally.
