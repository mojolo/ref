<h2 class="sect1">1.10. The Kernel and Daemons</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-154" />
<a name="upt3-IDXTERM-155" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-156" />If you
have arrived at Unix via Windows 2000 or some other personal computer
operating system, you will notice some big differences. Unix was, is,
and always will be a multiuser operating system. It is a multiuser
operating system even when you're the only person
using it; it is a multiuser operating system even when it is running
on a PC with a single keyboard; and this fact has important
ramifications for everything that you do.
</p>

<p>Why does this make a difference? Well, for one thing,
you're never the only one using the system, even
when you think you are. Don't bother to look under
your desk to see if there's an extra terminal hidden
down there. There isn't. But Unix is always doing
things "behind your back," running
programs of its own, whether you are aware of it or not. The most
important of these programs, the <em class="emphasis">kernel</em>, is the
heart of the Unix operating system itself. The kernel assigns memory
to each of the programs that are running, partitions time fairly so
that each program can get its job done, handles all I/O
(input/output) operations, and so on. Another important group of
programs, called <em class="emphasis">daemons</em>, are the
system's
"helpers." They run
continuously -- or from time to time -- performing small but
important tasks like handling mail, running network communications,
feeding data to your printer, keeping track of the time, and so on.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1262" /><a name="IXT-1-1263" />Not only are you sharing the
computer with the kernel and some mysterious daemons,
you're also sharing it with yourself. You can issue
the <b class="emphasis-bold">ps x</b><a name="IXT-1-1264" /><a name="IXT-1-1265" /> (<a href="ch24_05.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-5">Section 24.5</a>)
command to get a list of all processes running on your system. For
example:
</p>

<p>This output tells us that the user has only three windows open. You
may think that they're only running four or five
programs, but the computer is actually doing a lot more. (And, to
keep this brief, we aren't showing all the lines of
output!) The user logged into his Linux system on <b class="emphasis-bold">virtual console</b> (<a href="ch23_12.htm#upt3-CHP-23-SECT-12">Section 23.12</a>)
2, which shows as <tt class="literal">tty2</tt> in the
<tt class="literal">TTY</tt> column; a lot of programs are running there,
including the <b class="emphasis-bold">X Window System</b> (<a href="ch01_22.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-22">Section 1.22</a>) (which actually runs itself as another
user -- <em class="emphasis">root</em> -- so its process
isn't listed here).
<a name="IXT-1-1266" />The user is also running
<a name="IXT-1-1267" /><a name="IXT-1-1268" />Gnome and
Enlightenment, which keep track of the
<a name="IXT-1-1269" /><a name="IXT-1-1270" />workstation's
display. Two of the windows are Gnome
<a name="IXT-1-1271" />terminals,
which are windows that act like separate terminals; each has its own
<em class="emphasis">tty</em>, <tt class="literal">pts/0</tt> and
<tt class="literal">pts/1</tt>. And the list continues.
</p>

<p>If you are running a different window system (or no window system at
all) or different utility programs, you will see something different.
But we guarantee that you're running at least two
programs, and quite likely many more. If you want to see everything
that's running, including the daemons, type the
command <tt class="literal">ps aux</tt><a name="IXT-1-1272" /> <a name="IXT-1-1273" />
(Berkeley-style <i class="command">ps</i>) or <tt class="literal">ps -el</tt>
(for many other flavors of <i class="command">ps</i>).
You'll be impressed.
</p>

<p>Because there is so much going on at once, Unix requires a different
way of thinking. The Unix kernel is a traffic cop that mediates
different demands for time, memory, disks, and so on. Not only does
the kernel need to run your programs, but it also needs to run the
daemons, any programs that other users might want to start, or any
programs that you may have scheduled to run automatically, as
discussed in <a href="ch23_01.htm">Chapter 23</a>. When it runs a program,
the kernel allocates a small slice of time -- up to a
second -- and lets the program run until that slice is used up or
until the program decides to take a rest of its own accord (this is
called
"<a name="IXT-1-1274" />sleeping").
At this point, regardless of whether the program is finished, the
kernel finds some other program to run. The Unix kernel never takes a
vacation: it is always watching over the system.
</p>

<p>Once you understand that the kernel is a manager that schedules many
different kinds of activity, you understand a lot about how Unix
works. For example, if you have used any computer system previously,
you know that it's a bad idea to turn the computer
off while it is writing something to disk. You will probably destroy
the disk, and you could conceivably damage the disk drive. The same
is true for Unix -- but with an important complication. Any of the
programs that are running can start doing something to the disk at
any time. One of the daemons makes a point of accessing the disk
drive every 30 seconds or so, just to stay in touch. Therefore, you
can't just turn a Unix computer off. You might do
all sorts of damage to the system's files -- and
not just your own, but conceivably files belonging to many other
users. To turn a Unix system off, you must first run a program called
<i class="command">shutdown</i>, <a name="IXT-1-1275" /><a name="IXT-1-1276" />which kicks everyone off the system,
makes sure that a daemon won't try to play with a
disk drive when you aren't looking, and runs a
program named <i class="command">sync</i> to make sure that the disks
have the latest version of everything. Only then is it safe to pull
the switch. When you start up a Unix system, it automatically runs a
program called <i class="command">fsck</i><a name="IXT-1-1277" /><a name="IXT-1-1278" />, which stands for
"filesystem check"; its job is to
find out if you shut down the system correctly and try to fix any
damage that might have happened if you
didn't.<a name="IXTR3-1373" /> <a name="IXTR3-1374" /> <a name="IXTR3-1375" />
