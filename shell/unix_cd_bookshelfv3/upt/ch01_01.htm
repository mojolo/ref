<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />1.1. What's Special About Unix?</h2>

<p>If we were writing about any other operating system,
"power tools" might mean
"nifty add-on utilities to extend the power of your
operating system." That sounds suspiciously like a
definition of Unix: an operating system loaded with
decades' worth of nifty add-on utilities.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1113" />Unix is unique in that it
wasn't designed as a commercial operating system
meant to run application programs, but as a hacker's
toolset, by and for programmers. In fact, an early release of the
operating system went by the name PWB (Programmer's
Work Bench).
</p>

<p>When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie first wrote Unix at AT&amp;T
Bell Labs, it was for their own use and for their friends and
coworkers. Utility programs were added by various people as they had
problems to solve. Because Bell Labs wasn't in the
computer business, source code was given out to universities for a
nominal fee. Brilliant researchers wrote their own software and added
it to Unix in a spree of creative anarchy, which has been equaled
only with Linux, in the introduction of the <b class="emphasis-bold">X
Window System</b> (<a href="ch01_22.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-22">Section 1.22</a>), and
especially the blend of Mac and Unix with Darwin included in the
<a name="IXT-1-1114" />Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>Unlike most other operating systems, where free software remains an
unsupported add-on, Unix has taken as its own the work of thousands
of independent programmers. During the commercialization of Unix
within the past several years, this incorporation of outside software
has slowed down for larger Unix installations, such as
Sun's Solaris and HP's hp-ux, but
not stopped entirely. This is especially true with the newer lighter
versions of Unix, such as the various flavors of
<a name="IXT-1-1115" /><a name="IXT-1-1116" />Linux and Darwin.
</p>

<p>Therefore, a book on Unix inevitably <em class="emphasis">has</em> to
focus not just on add-on utilities (though we do include many of
those), but on how to use clever features of the many utilities that
have been made part of Unix over the years.
</p>

<p>Unix is also important to power users because it's
one of the last popular operating systems that
doesn't force you to work behind an interface of
menus, windows, and mouse with a
"one-size(-doesn't)-fit-all"
programming interface. Yes, you can use Unix interfaces with windows
and menus -- and they can be great time savers in a lot of cases.
But Unix also gives you building blocks that, with some training and
practice, will give you many more choices than any software designer
can cram onto a set of menus. If you learn to use Unix and its
utilities from the command line, you don't have to
be a programmer to do very powerful things with a few keystrokes.
</p>

<p>So, it's also essential that this book teach you
some of the underlying principles that make Unix such a
tinkerer's paradise.
</p>

<p>In the body of this book, we assume that you are already moderately
familiar with Unix -- a journeyman hacker wanting to become a
master. But at the same time, we don't want to leave
beginners entirely at sea; so in this chapter, we include some
fundamental concepts. We've tried to intersperse
some simple tips and tricks to keep things interesting, but the ratio
of concept articles to tips is much higher than in any other part of
the book. The concepts covered are also much more basic. If you
aren't a beginner, you can safely skip this chapter,
though we may bounce you back here if you don't
understand something later in the book.
</p>

<p>Don't expect a complete introduction to
Unix -- if you need that, buy an introductory book. What
you'll find here is a selection of key concepts that
you'll need to understand to progress beyond the
beginner stage, as well as answers to frequently asked questions and
problems. In some ways, consider this introduction a teaser. If you
are a beginner, we want to show you enough of Unix to whet your
appetite for more.
</p>

<p>Also, don't expect everything to be in order.
Because we don't want you to get in the habit of
reading through each chapter from beginning to end, as in most books,
the articles in this chapter are in loose order.
We've tried not to make you jump around too much,
but we've also avoided a lot of the transitional
material that makes reading most books a chore.
