<h2 class="sect1">11.10. make Isn't Just for Programmers!</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1852" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1853" />
<a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1854" />The <i class="command">make</i>
program is a Unix facility for describing dependencies among a group
of related files, usually ones that are part of the same project.
This facility has enjoyed widespread use in software-development
projects. Programmers use <i class="command">make</i> to describe how to
"make" a program -- which source
files need to be compiled, which libraries must be included, and
which object files need to be linked. By keeping track of these
relationships in a single place, individual members of a
software-development team can make changes to a single module, run
<i class="command">make</i>, and be assured that the program reflects the
latest changes made by others on the team.
</p>

<p>Only by a leap of the imagination do we group <i class="command">make</i>
with the other commands for keeping track of differences between
files. However, although it does not compare two versions of the same
source file, it can be used to compare versions of a source file and
to the formatted output.
</p>

<p>Part of what makes Unix a productive environment for text processing
is discovering other uses for standard programs. The
<i class="command">make</i> utility has many possible applications for a
documentation project. One such use is to maintain up-to-date copies
of formatted files -- which make up a single manual and provide
users with a way of obtaining a printed copy of the entire manual
without having to know which <b class="emphasis-bold">preprocessors or
formatting options</b> (<a href="ch45_13.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-13">Section 45.13</a>) need to
be used.
</p>

<p>The basic operation that <i class="command">make</i> performs is to
compare two sets of files -- for example, formatted and
unformatted files -- and determine if any members of one set, the
unformatted files, are more recent than their counterpart in the
other set, the formatted files.
<a name="IXT-11-6089" />This is accomplished by simply
comparing the <b class="emphasis-bold">last-modification date</b>
(<a href="ch08_02.htm#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-2">Section 8.2</a>)
("timestamp") of pairs of files. If
the unformatted source file has been modified since the formatted
file was made, <i class="command">make</i> executes the specified command
to "remake" the formatted file.
</p>

<p>To use <i class="command">make</i>, you have to write a description file,
usually named <em class="emphasis">Makefile</em><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1856" /> (or <em class="emphasis">makefile</em>),
that resides in the working directory for the project. The
<em class="emphasis">Makefile</em> specifies a hierarchy of dependencies
among individual files, called components. At the top of this
hierarchy is a target. For our example, you can think of the target
as a printed copy of a book; the components are formatted files
generated by processing an unformatted file with <b class="emphasis-bold">nroff</b> (<a href="ch45_12.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-12">Section 45.12</a>).
</p>

<p>Here's the <em class="emphasis">Makefile</em> that
reflects these dependencies:
</p>
<p><tt class="literal">lp</tt> <a href="ch45_02.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">Section 45.2</a></p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">manual: ch01.fmt ch02.fmt ch03.fmt
        lp ch0[1-3].fmt
ch01.fmt: ch01
        nroff -mm ch01 &gt; ch01.fmt
ch02.fmt: ch02
        tbl ch02 | nroff -mm &gt; ch02.fmt
ch03.fmt: ch03a ch03b ch03c
        nroff -mm ch03[abc] &gt; ch03.fmt</pre></blockquote>

<p>This hierarchy is represented in <a href="ch10_13.htm#upt3-CHP-10-FIG-1">Figure 10-1</a>.</p>

<a name="upt3-CHP-11-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/upt3_1101.gif" alt="Figure 11-1" width="414" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 11-1. What Makefile describes: Files and commands to make manual</h4>

<p>The target is <em class="emphasis">manual</em>, which is made up of three
formatted files whose names appear after the colon. Each of these
components has its own dependency line. For instance,
<em class="emphasis">ch01.fmt</em> is dependent upon a coded file named
<em class="emphasis">ch01</em>. Underneath the dependency line is the
command that generates <em class="emphasis">ch01.fmt</em>. Each command
line must begin with a TAB.
</p>

<p>When you enter the command <tt class="literal">make</tt>, the end result is
that the three formatted files are spooled to the printer. However, a
sequence of operations is performed before this final action. The
dependency line for each component is evaluated, determining if the
coded file has been modified since the last time the formatted file
was made. The formatting command will be executed only if the coded
file is more recent. After all the components are made, the <b class="emphasis-bold">lp</b> (<a href="ch45_02.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">Section 45.2</a>) command is
executed.
</p>

<p>As an example of this process, we'll assume that all
the formatted files are up-to-date. Then by editing the source file
<em class="emphasis">ch03a</em>, we change the modification time. When you
execute the <i class="command">make</i> command, any output files
dependent on <em class="emphasis">ch03a</em> are reformatted:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>make</b></tt>
nroff -mm ch03[abc] &gt; ch03.fmt
lp ch0[1-3].fmt</pre></blockquote>

<p>Only <em class="emphasis">ch03.fmt</em> needs to be remade. As soon as
that formatting command finishes, the command underneath the target
<em class="emphasis">manual</em> is executed, spooling the files to the
printer.
</p>

<p>Although this example has actually made only limited use of
<i class="command">make</i>'s facilities, we hope it
suggests more ways to use <i class="command">make</i> in a documention
project. You can keep your <em class="emphasis">Makefiles</em> just this
simple, or you can go on to learn additional notation, such as
internal macros and suffixes, in an effort to generalize the
description file for increased usefulness.
