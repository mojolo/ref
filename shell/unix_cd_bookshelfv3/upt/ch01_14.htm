<h2 class="sect1">1.14. The Tree Structure of the Filesystem</h2>

<p>A multiuser system needs a way to let different users have different
files with the same name. It also needs a way to keep files in
logical groups. With thousands of system files and hundreds of files
per user, it would be disastrous to have all of the files in one big
heap. Even single-user operating systems have found it necessary to
go beyond "flat" filesystem
structures.
</p>

<p>Almost every operating system solved this problem by implementing a
tree-structured, or <em class="emphasis">hierarchical</em>, filesystem.
Unix is no exception. A hierarchical filesystem is not much different
from a set of filing cabinets at the office. Your set of cabinets
consists of many individual cabinets. Each individual cabinet has
several drawers; each drawer may have several partitions in it; each
partition may have several hanging (Pendaflex) folders; and each
hanging folder may have several files. You can specify an individual
file by naming the filing cabinet, the drawer, the partition, the
group of folders, and the individual folder. For example, you might
say to someone: "Get me the
`meeting of July 9' file from the
Kaiser folder in the Medical Insurance Plans partition in the
Benefits drawer of the Personnel file cabinet." This
is backwards from the way you'd specify a filename,
because it starts with the mfost specific part, but the idea is
essentially the same.
</p>

<p>You could give a complete path like this to any file in any of your
cabinets, as shown in <a href="ch01_14.htm#upt3-CHP-1-FIG-2">Figure 1-2</a>. The concept of a
"path" lets you distinguish your
July 9 meeting with Kaiser from your July 9 interview with a job
applicant or your July 9 policy-planning meeting. It also lets you
keep related topics together: it's easy to browse
through the "Medical Insurance"
section of one drawer or to scan all your literature and notes about
the Kaiser plan. The Unix filesystem works in exactly the same way
(as do most other hierarchical filesystems). Rather than having a
heap of assorted
<a name="IXT-1-1324" />files, files are organized into
<em class="emphasis">directories</em>. A directory is really nothing more
than a special kind of file that lists a bunch of other files (see
<a href="ch10_02.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-2">Section 10.2</a>). A directory can contain any
number of files (although for performance reasons,
it's a good idea to keep the number of files in one
directory relatively small -- under 100, when you can). A
directory can also contain other directories. Because a directory is
nothing more than a special kind of file, directories also have
names. At the top (the filesystem
"tree" is really upside down) is a
directory called the "root," which
has the special name <tt class="literal">/</tt> (pronounced
"slash," but never spelled out).
</p>

<p>To locate any file, we can give a sequence of names, starting from
the filesystem's root, that shows the
file's exact position in the filesystem: we start
with the root and then list the directories you go through to find
the file, separating them by slashes. This is called a
<em class="emphasis">path</em>. For examples, let's look
at the simple filesystem represented by <a href="ch01_14.htm#upt3-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a>.
The names <em class="emphasis">/home/mkl/mystuff/stuff</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/home/hun/publick/stuff</em> both refer to files
named <em class="emphasis">stuff</em>. However, these files are in
different directories, so they are different files. The names
<em class="emphasis">home</em>, <em class="emphasis">hun</em>, and so on are
all names of directories. Complete paths like these are called
"absolute paths." There are shorter
ways to refer to a file: <b class="emphasis-bold">relative
paths</b> (<a href="ch01_16.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-16">Section 1.16</a>).
