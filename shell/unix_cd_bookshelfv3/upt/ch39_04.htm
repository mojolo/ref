<h2 class="sect1">39.4. Managing and Sharing Files with RCS and CVS</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-39-2849" /><a name="IXT-39-2850" /><a name="IXT-39-2851" /><a name="IXT-39-2852" /><a name="IXT-39-2853" />How many times have
you wished that you could get a copy of a file the way it looked an
hour ago, or yesterday, or last year? That includes times when you
just deleted the file -- and, especially, when the file is too new
for your computer's backup system to have made any
copies of it. (You <em class="emphasis">do</em> have regular backups of
your system, don't you? <tt class="literal">;-)</tt>)
<a name="IXT-39-2854" /><a name="IXT-39-2855" />RCS (Revision Control System) and CVS
(Concurrent Version System) let you recover a previous version of a
file from an archive. Many systems come with either RCS, CVS, or both
installed already; if they don't appear to be on
your system either install the appropriate package or grab the most
current versions from <a name="IXT-39-2856" />FSF's website
(<a href="http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</a>).
</p>

<p>How does the archive get there? As you work, you periodically put a
"snapshot" of the file into the
archive. (The archive systems save the
<em class="emphasis">changes</em> -- not the whole file -- so this
doesn't take as much disk space as it might.) The
archive remembers the date and time you store each version. You can
enter a log message to describe what's changed since
the last time you archived the file. You can do much more, but those
are the basics.
</p>

<p>When you need a previous version of the file, you read the archive
log to decide which version is best (by date and time or by the log
message). Then you use one command to get back that version. You
don't have to wait for the system manager to load a
tape.
</p>

<p>Of course, these tools can't protect you from a disk
crash or another disaster; that's what reliable
backups are for. <span class="acronym">RCS</span> and <span class="acronym">CVS</span>
are best for protecting you from accidentally deleting or corrupting
files. But they're also great for group development
projects: controlling who's working on a file, who
did what when, and so on. That's especially true of
CVS, which was designed to handle software developers from around the
world collaborating on a project over a network -- as well as a
group of developers in the same office. One of my favorite features
is the ability to see <b class="emphasis-bold">diff</b>
(<a name="IXT-39-2857" /><a href="ch11_01.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 11.1</a>) listings of
what's changed between versions.
</p>

<p>Once you get started with these tools, you'll wonder
how you ever did without them. <a href="ch39_05.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-5">Section 39.5</a>
explains how to protect your files with RCS. See <a href="ch39_07.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-7">Section 39.7</a> for an introduction to CVS.
