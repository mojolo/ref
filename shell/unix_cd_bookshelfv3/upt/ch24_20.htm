<h2 class="sect1">24.20. The Process Chain to Your Window</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-3677" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-3678" />Almost <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-3679" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-3680" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-3681" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-3682" />everything we
cover in this book works as well from an old-style, full-screen
terminal as it does from an terminal window (like
<i class="command">xterm</i>) under the <b class="emphasis-bold">X Window
System</b> (<a href="ch01_22.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-22">Section 1.22</a>). Actually, a lot of
it works on an old printing teletype, too! In all of those cases,
you're interacting with a Unix shell. This article
covers things you should know about using a shell from an X window.
We'll talk specifically about the X11R6
<i class="command">xterm</i> client, but this generally applies to any
window with a shell inside of it -- like GNOME terminal. This is a
guided tour, so it helps to be at a workstation or other X display.
If you can't take the tour, please scan through and
look for the points I make along the way.
</p>

<p>If you don't have an <i class="command">xterm</i> window
open, open one (by clicking on an icon, choosing a menu entry, or
however you usually do it). We'll call this the
"first window." Find its <b class="emphasis-bold">tty</b> (<a href="ch02_07.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-7">Section 2.7</a>). Next, in
this first window, <b class="emphasis-bold">set an environment
variable</b> (<a href="ch35_03.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 35.3</a>) with a unique name
and any value you want. You might call it
<em class="emphasis">FAVCOLOR</em> and set the value to
<em class="emphasis">purple</em>. Then, in that same window, type
<tt class="literal">cd /tmp</tt> to change your current directory to
<em class="emphasis">/tmp</em>. Finally, type <tt class="literal">xterm -rv
-sb</tt> (with <em class="emphasis">no</em> <tt class="literal">&amp;</tt>
after its name); this should open a second <i class="command">xterm</i>
window. Here's what that first
<i class="command">xterm</i> should look like (we'll
show C shell syntax here):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>tty</b></tt>
/dev/pts/1
% <tt class="userinput"><b>setenv FAVCOLOR purple</b></tt>
% <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /tmp</b></tt>
% <tt class="userinput"><b>xterm -rv -sb</b></tt>
<i class="lineannotation">   (cursor sits here; there's no shell prompt)</i></pre></blockquote>

<p>When your new second <i class="command">xterm</i> pops open, it should be
in reverse video (swapped foreground/background colors, the
<span class="option">-rv</span> option) to make it easy to identify, with a
scrollbar too. In it, type <tt class="literal">tty</tt> to get its
<em class="emphasis">tty</em> number, which will be different from the
previous <i class="command">xterm</i>'s. Run <b class="emphasis-bold">env or printenv</b> (<a href="ch35_03.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 35.3</a>), and you should see the special environment
variable (like <em class="emphasis">FAVCOLOR</em>) that you set. Type
<tt class="literal">pwd</tt>; the current directory should be
<em class="emphasis">/tmp</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-77">[77]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-77" /><p> [77]If your <b class="emphasis-bold">setup files assume you're in your home
directory</b> (<a href="ch03_07.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-7">Section 3.7</a>), you may have
some problems.</p> </blockquote>

<p>If you've managed to follow this twisty series of
steps, you've started a chain of <b class="emphasis-bold">processes</b> (<a href="ch24_03.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-3">Section 24.3</a>).
</p>

<p>You can see that chain of processes by typing the command
<a name="IXT-24-5430" /><b class="emphasis-bold">ps aux or ps
-ef</b> (<a href="ch24_05.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-5">Section 24.5</a>). You should get lines
something like these:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>tty</b></tt>
/dev/pts/3
% <tt class="userinput"><b>ps -ef</b></tt>
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
jpeek      675     1  0 May13 ?        00:00:14 xterm
jpeek      681   675  0 May13 pts/1    00:00:00 zsh
jpeek    14850   681  0 15:58 pts/1    00:00:00 xterm -rv -sb
jpeek    14852 14850  0 15:58 pts/3    00:00:00 zsh
jpeek    14992 14852  0 16:07 pts/3    00:00:00 ps -ef</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is the chain of processes that led to the second window.
Let's start from the bottom and work up. From the
<tt class="literal">ps -ef</tt> command,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-78">[78]</a> you'll see that the
<i class="command">ps</i> command itself had PID (process ID) 14992; its
parent's PID (PPID) was 14852. So the process that
started the <i class="command">ps</i> process is the shell running in
that window: in my case, a Z shell, <tt class="literal">zsh</tt>, with PID
14852. Notice that both of these processes are running on the same
<b class="emphasis-bold">tty</b> (<a href="ch02_07.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-7">Section 2.7</a>)
named <tt class="literal">pts/3</tt>. That's a way to find
all the processes in a particular window: check the tty name. This
<i class="command">zsh</i> is the shell running in this particular
<i class="command">xterm</i>. When you exit the shell (by typing CTRL-d
or <i class="command">exit</i>), the window will close too -- but
don't try that yet! Instead, find the parent of the
shell; it's the <i class="command">xterm</i> process,
which is running on -- are you surprised? -- another tty,
<tt class="literal">pts/1</tt>. This makes sense, because you started
<em class="emphasis">xterm</em> from another window, the first window.
There's a shell running in the first window too;
it's the <i class="command">zsh</i> with PID 681. The
parent of the first window's shell is, yes, another
<i class="command">xterm</i>, PID 675. And its parent has PID 1; this is
<b class="emphasis-bold">init</b> (<a href="ch24_02.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-2">Section 24.2</a>),
the "grandparent" of all processes
on your system.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-78" /><p> [78]Note that, if your
system's process ID numbers have
"recycled" and started over from 1,
the <i class="command">ps</i> command may not have the highest
number.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Your window system may not work quite this way. The parent of the
top-level <i class="command">xterm</i> might not be
<i class="command">init</i>. Also, an <i class="command">xterm</i> could be
owned by <em class="emphasis">root</em> instead of by you. Still, you
should have a "chain" of processes,
something like the one I described, on your system.
</p>

<p>Why did we go through all this? One reason is so
you'll know how to track the processes that lead to
an <i class="command">xterm</i> -- and to know what to look for if you
have to <b class="emphasis-bold">kill</b>
(<a name="IXT-24-5431" /><a href="ch24_12.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-12">Section 24.12</a>) a hung window or a process in a window.
It's also to show that the environment from a parent
window (here, the first window) -- the current directory,
environment variables, and so on -- is passed to the child window
(here, the second window). Finally, it's to show
what happens when you <a name="IXT-24-5432" /><a name="IXT-24-5433" /><a name="IXT-24-5434" />close a window by exiting the shell:
the shell terminates, so its parent <i class="command">xterm</i> process
terminates too.
</p>

<p>So what happens to a shell running in a window if you close the
window by clicking the "X" box on
the window frame or by choosing the <em class="emphasis">close</em> or
<em class="emphasis">destroy</em> commands in the window manager? The
<i class="command">xterm</i> gets a <b class="emphasis-bold">signal</b> (<a href="ch24_10.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-10">Section 24.10</a>), and the
system hopes that it dies. But it may <em class="emphasis">not</em> die,
and the process may stay around. Instead of trusting the window
manager to kill a window and the processes in it, I tend to use
<i class="command">ps</i> so I know for sure that all the processes are
gone. Knowing the stuff we've looked at here lets me
identify a window and its processes.
</p>

<p>But let's not kill things! Instead, in the second
window, type <i class="command">exit</i> at the prompt. The window should
go away. And, in the first window, you should have a new prompt. (If
you had started the second <i class="command">xterm</i> in the <b class="emphasis-bold">background</b> (<a href="ch23_02.htm#upt3-CHP-23-SECT-2">Section 23.2</a>), you
could have kept working in the first window while the second window
ran, too. <a name="IXT-24-5435" /><a name="IXT-24-5436" /><a name="IXT-24-5437" /><a name="IXT-24-5438" />But watch out for the
<i class="command">zsh</i> and <i class="command">ksh</i> options named
<em class="emphasis">bg_nice</em> and <em class="emphasis">bgnice</em>,
respectively, which run background commands at lower priority. You
probably don't want your new windows to run at low
priority, so be sure that option isn't <a name="IXTR3-5473" /> <a name="IXTR3-5474" />set.)<a name="IXTR3-5475" /> <a name="IXTR3-5476" /> <a name="IXTR3-5477" /> <a name="IXTR3-5478" />
</p>
