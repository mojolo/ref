<h2 class="sect1">20.9. patch: Generalized Updating of Files That Differ</h2>

<p><img src="figs/www.gif" alt="Figure " width="25" /> Go to <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3">http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: patch</p>

<p><a name="IXT-20-260" /> <a name="IXT-20-261" />Like all of Larry
Wall's widely used programs (including <b class="emphasis-bold">perl</b> (<a href="ch41_01.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-1">Section 41.1</a>), a
software configuration script called <i class="command">Configure</i>,
and the <i class="command">rn</i> news reader), <i class="command">patch</i>
betrays a whimsical intelligence of its own. Feed it any kind of
<b class="emphasis-bold">diff listing</b>
(<a name="IXT-20-262" /><a href="ch11_01.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 11.1</a>)
(not just an editing script produced with the <span class="option">-e</span>
option -- the typical way before <i class="command">patch</i> came
around). <i class="command">patch</i> figures out what it needs to do to
apply the diff, and updates the file, supplying all the while a
breezy commentary on what it's doing:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>patch &lt; testfile.diff</b></tt>
Hmm...  Looks like a normal diff to me...
File to patch: <tt class="userinput"><b>testfile</b></tt>
Patching file testfile using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 2.
done</pre></blockquote>

<p>As Larry once noted, <i class="command">patch</i> has done an awful lot
to "change the culture of
computing." Almost all free software is now updated
by means of patches rather than complete new releases.
<i class="command">patch</i> is smart enough to discard any leading or
trailing garbage (such as mail headers or signatures), so a program
source file can be updated by piping a mail message containing a diff
listing between old and new versions directly to
<i class="command">patch</i>.
</p>

<p>Here are a few of the other things <i class="command">patch</i> is smart
enough to do:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Figure out the name of the file to be updated and do it without
asking (usually only if the diff file is a <b class="emphasis-bold">context diff</b> (<a href="ch11_03.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-3">Section 11.3</a>)
produced with the <span class="option">-c</span> option).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Look for a suitable <b class="emphasis-bold">RCS or CVS</b>
(<a href="ch39_04.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-4">Section 39.4</a>) file and check it out, if the filename
itself can't be found.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Handle diff listings that don't quite match. This
makes it possible for <i class="command">patch</i> to update a file that
the recipient has already changed from the one that the diff was
based on.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Save any pieces of the diff file that don't end up
being used, in a file named by adding the suffix
<em class="emphasis">.rej</em> (reject) to the name of the file being
patched.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Back up the file that is being patched, appending the suffix
<em class="emphasis">.orig</em> to the name of the file being patched.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Recognize that its input may actually apply to several files, and
patch each of them separately. For example, a whole directory might
be updated by a "patch" file that
contained diff listings for each of the files in the directory. (By
the way, the <span class="option">-d</span> option to <i class="command">patch</i>
tells it to <i class="command">cd</i> to a specified directory before
starting work.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="IXT-20-263" />Recognize
(or at least speculate) that a patch might have been created
incorrectly, with the old and new files swapped. Larry says,
"Yes, I'm afraid that does happen
occasionally, human nature being what it is."
<em class="emphasis">patch</em>'s <span class="option">-R</span>
option will force <i class="command">patch</i> to reverse the sense of
the patch; what's really amusing is to see
<i class="command">patch</i> suggest that this might be the thing to do,
when things seem out of sync.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you are a programmer, <i class="command">patch</i> is worth studying
just to see how much a program can do to anticipate errors, deal with
fuzzy input, and in general "make the computer do
the dirty work." But if you're a
programmer, you doubtless already know about
<i class="command">patch</i>.
</p>

<p>One last note: <i class="command">patch</i> is so useful that
it's been added to many Unix systems. Check to see
if your system has it before installing the program. Some versions of
<i class="command">patch</i> we've seen are limted
versions or buggy when they come from software vendors, though. The
one on the book's website is worth comparing to
yours.
