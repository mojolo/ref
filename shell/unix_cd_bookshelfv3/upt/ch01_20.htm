<h2 class="sect1">1.20. Scripting</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1345" />Scripting languages and scripting
applications differ from compiled languages and applications in that
the application is interpreted as run rather than compiled into a
machine-understandable format. You can use shell scripting for many
of your scripting needs, but there are times when
you'll want to use something more sophisticated.
Though not directly a part of a Unix system, most Unix installations
come with the tools you need for this more complex
scripting -- Perl (<a href="ch41_01.htm">Chapter 41</a>), Python (<a href="ch42_01.htm">Chapter 42</a>), and Tcl.
</p>

<p>These three scripting languages seem so prevelant within the Unix
world that I think of them as the Unix Scripting language
triumvirate.
</p>

<p>Perl is probably the granddaddy of scripting. Created by Larry Wall,
this language is probably used more than any other for creating
complex scripts to perform sophisticated functionality with Unix and
other operating systems. The language is particularly noted for its
ability to handle regular expressions, as well as working with files
and other forms of I/O.
</p>

<p>Python isn't as widespread as Perl, but its
popularity is growing. One reason it's gaining
popularity is that as a language, Python is more structured and a
little more verbose than Perl, and therefore a little easier to read.
In addition, according to its fans, Python has more object-oriented
and data-manipulation features than the file-manipulation and
regular-expression manipulation of Perl.
</p>

<p>Tcl is particularly prevelant within Linux systems, though
it's use is widespread throughout all Unix systems.
It's popular because it's simpler
to learn than Perl and allows scripters to get up to speed more
quickly than you can with Perl or Python. In addition, the language
also has access to a very popular graphical user interface library
called the Tk toolkit. You'll rarely hear about Tcl
without the associated Tk.
