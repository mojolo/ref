<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />6.1. Defining Keys and Button Presses with xmodmap</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1092" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1093" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1094" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1095" />If you have a Linux system, you may
want to use <i class="command">loadkeys</i><a name="IXT-6-838" /><a name="IXT-6-839" /> instead of
<i class="command">xmodmap</i>. <i class="command">loadkeys</i> is designed
to set the keymap used by the system as a whole, particularly the
console, so use your own judgment. Whatever is done in
<i class="command">xmodmap</i> will affect X but not the system console.
</p>

<p>An important piece to the X Window System puzzle is filled by the
<i class="command">xmodmap</i> client. When the user performs any
action -- such as typing a key or moving the mouse -- the
server sends a packet of information to the client called an
<em class="emphasis">event</em>. These events are then translated into
actions by the client. You can use the <i class="command">xmodmap</i>
utility to effectively change the event that is reported to the
client.
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Keysym mappings</em><a name="IXT-6-840" /><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1099" /> are mappings of keyboard events at the
server level, before the event is sent to the client.
<em class="emphasis">Keysyms</em> are the
<a name="IXT-6-841" />symbols used
for each key on the keyboard.
</p>

<p>The X server maintains a <em class="emphasis">keymap
table</em><a name="IXT-6-842" />, which contains a listing of keys on the
keyboard and how they should be interpreted. A client gets the keymap
table from the server upon client startup. In most cases, the keymap
table is used to interpret keys literally -- when you press the
letter "a," a key code is sent to
the client that corresponds to the letter
"a" in the keymap table.
</p>

<p>You can use the <i class="command">xmodmap</i> client to reassign key
codes within the keymap table. <i class="command">xmodmap</i> can
therefore be used to redefine how the key is interpreted by the
client. You probably wouldn't want to translate the
alphanumeric keys on the keyboard, but you may want to translate
others. For example, you might want to change the BACKSPACE key to
DELETE:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% xmodmap -e "keysym BackSpace = Delete"</pre></blockquote>

<p>Another example is if you mistakenly hit the <a name="IXT-6-843" />CAPS LOCK key a bit too often, you can
disable it completely. Some people might disable CAPS LOCK the
low-tech way (by just removing the key from the keyboard!), but you
can also render it harmless with the command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% xmodmap -e "keysym Caps_Lock = "</pre></blockquote>

<p>effectively disabling the CAPS LOCK key entirely. Note that the
symbol is now gone and can't be redefined without
using the hardware key code.
</p>

<p>If you are a <a name="IXT-6-844" /> <a name="IXT-6-845" />DVORAK typist, you can use
<i class="command">xmodmap</i> to translate every key on the keyboard and
so your QWERTY keyboard behaves like a DVORAK keyboard.
</p>

<p>If it ever seems that keystrokes are not working correctly, you can
check current keysym settings by running <i class="command">xmodmap</i>
with the <span class="option">-pk</span> argument. Use the
<i class="command">xev</i> client to determine exactly which key code a
key generates on your display. There is also a public domain client
called <i class="command">xkeycaps</i> that can be used to display the
keysyms for selected keyboards.
</p>

<p>You can use <i class="command">xmodmap</i> to add or remove keysyms, or
even to redefine the key code associated with that keysym. You can
also use it to redefine the mouse buttons, using the
<tt class="literal">pointer</tt> keyword. For example, to have the second
and third mouse button switch places, you can enter:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2"</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you have a large number of keys to remap, you can put the commands
in a file that is read when your X session starts. For example,
create a file called <em class="emphasis">.Xmodmap</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">! my .Xmodmap file
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
  ...</pre></blockquote>

<p>These commands effectively reverse your CTRL and CAPS LOCK keys.
(CTRL and CAPS LOCK are "switched"
on <a name="IXT-6-846" /><a name="IXT-6-847" />PC and Macintosh keyboards, which
can be exceedingly frustrating.) This file can then be read
automatically in a X startup script:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">  ...
xset b 10 100 10
xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults
<tt class="userinput"><b>xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap</b></tt>
fvwm &amp;
  ...</pre></blockquote>

<p>Alternately, you might want to assign different functions to
little-used keys, such as making the tiny
"enter" key on Powerbook keyboards
into another command key. Remember, too, that some keys may have
different names than what you're used to. Sun
keyboards, for example, often come with a
"meta" key; Macintosh keyboards
have an "option" key where PC users
expect to find "alt" (though they
act the same); and so forth.
</p>

<p>On <a name="IXT-6-848" />Linux systems, the
<i class="command">loadkeys</i> command is often used to make
system-level changes to key mappings; it's common to
see a variety of keytables already defined and a system default
chosen from among them. The system default is often found in
<em class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/keytable</em> (Red Hat 6 and earlier)
or <em class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</em> (Red Hat 7) or
otherwise defined in a directory such as
<em class="filename">/usr/share/keymaps</em> or
<em class="filename">/usr/lib/kbd/keymaps</em>. On Debian, the keytable is
simply set in
<em class="filename">/etc/console-tools/default.kmap.gz</em>.
</p>

<p>If you have a physical keyboard on which you've
switched certain keys, you may want to modify the
<a name="IXT-6-849" />system-level key mappings as well, so
that they are always loaded properly for those times when you need
the console to work without any special user-level configuration. For
example, on my <a name="IXT-6-850" />Red Hat systems, I always
modify my keymap (in 6.* and earlier, found in
<em class="filename">/usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.kmap.gz</em>, and
in 7.*, found in
<em class="filename">/lib/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.kmap.gz</em>) to
reflect the fact that the keyboard I carry with me to the co-lo has
swapped CAPS LOCK and CTRL keys. Just <i class="command">gunzip</i> the
file, edit, and then <i class="command">gzip</i> it back up again.
Alternately, you can create a new file from an existing one, make
your edits, and specify the new file in your
<em class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/keytable</em> or
<em class="filename">/etc/syscongig/keyboard</em> file, as appropriate.
</p>

<p>The keymaps directory tree is broken down by the platform (Amiga,
Atari, i386, Mac, Sun) and then by the layout type of the keyboard
(<a name="IXT-6-851" /><a name="IXT-6-852" />DVORAK,
QWERTY, and various other layouts) and finally by the language or
character set. So, there is a U.S. keymap, a U.K. keymap, a Hebrew
keymap, and dozens of various others, for all of the systems on which
Linux is supported. The files are in a relatively straightforward
format:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">keycode  54 = Shift
keycode  56 = Alt
keycode  57 = space
        control keycode  57 = nul
keycode  58 = Control
keycode  86 = less             greater          bar
keycode  97 = Control</pre></blockquote>

<p>First comes the <tt class="literal">keycode</tt><a name="IXT-6-853" /> keyword, followed by the numeric value
of the keysym generated when the key is pressed, and then a keyword
(or several) describing the character to be generated when a given
keysym is received. Modifiers may precede the
<tt class="literal">keycode</tt> keyword, binding the combination of
modifier key and keysym to another character value.
</p>

<a name="ch06-3-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> 
One danger of using <i class="command">xmodmap</i> is that anything set
with <i class="command">xmodmap</i> might remain in effect after you have
logged out. This isn't a problem if you use the same
X server every day, but be aware that if you use a
coworker's X terminal in his absence, he may come
back complaining that you broke his CAPS LOCK key. This might happen
if you use <i class="command">xdm</i>, since the server is not restarted
after every X session. On some X terminals, you can fix this problem
by toggling "Retain X Settings" on
the X terminal setup menu.<a name="IXTR3-959" /> <a name="IXTR3-960" /> <a name="IXTR3-961" /> <a name="IXTR3-962" />
