<h2 class="sect1">36.2. The Story of : # #!</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-36-3175" />Once <a name="IXT-36-3176" />upon a time, there was the Bourne
shell. Since there was only "the"
shell, there was no trouble deciding how to run a script: run it with
<em class="emphasis">the</em> shell. It worked, and everyone was happy.
</p>

<p>Along came progress and wrote another shell. The people thought this
was good, for now they could choose their own shell. So some chose
the one, and some the other, and they wrote shell scripts and were
happy. But one day someone who used the
"other" shell ran a script by
someone who used the "other other"
shell, and alas! it bombed spectacularly. The people wailed and
called upon their Guru for help.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-36-3177" />"Well,"
said the Guru, "I see the problem. The one shell and
the other are not compatible. We need to make sure that the shells
know which other shell to use to run each script.
<a name="IXT-36-3178" />And lo! the one shell has a
'comment' called :, and the other a
true comment called <tt class="literal">#</tt>. I hereby decree that
henceforth, the one shell will run scripts that start with :, and the
other those that start with <tt class="literal">#</tt>."
And it was so, and the people were happy.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-36-3179" /><a name="IXT-36-3180" /><a name="IXT-36-3181" />But progress was not finished.
This time he noticed that only shells ran scripts and thought that if
the kernel too could run scripts, this would be good, and the people
would be happy. So he wrote more code, and now the kernel could run
scripts but only if they began with the magic incantation
<tt class="literal">#!</tt><a name="IXT-36-3182" />, and if
they told the kernel which shell ran the script. And it was so, and
the people were confused.
</p>

<p>For the <tt class="literal">#!</tt> looked like a
"comment." Though the kernel could
see the <tt class="literal">#!</tt> and run a shell, it would not do so
unless certain magic bits were set. And if the incantation were
mispronounced, that too could stop the kernel, which, after all, was
not omniscient. And so the people wailed, but alas! the Guru did not
respond. And so it was, and still it is today. Anyway, you will get
best results from a 4BSD machine by using
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#! /bin/sh</pre></blockquote>

<p>or:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#! /bin/csh</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="IXT-36-3183" />as the
first line of your script. <tt class="literal">#!</tt> <tt class="literal">/bin/csh
-f</tt> is also helpful on occasion, and it's
usually faster because <i class="command">csh</i> won't
read your <b class="emphasis-bold">.cshrc file</b> (<a href="ch03_03.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 3.3</a>).
