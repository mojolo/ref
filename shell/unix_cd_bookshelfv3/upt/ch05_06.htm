<h2 class="sect1">5.6. Checklist: Terminal Hangs When I Log In</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-866" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-867" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-868" />If
<a name="IXT-5-7333" />your terminal seems to
"hang" (freeze, lock up) when you
log in, here are some things to try:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Have another user look at your shell's <b class="emphasis-bold">setup files</b> (<a href="ch03_03.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 3.3</a>).
There could be some obvious mistakes that you didn't
catch.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="IXT-5-7334" />Log in to another account and use
the <em class="emphasis">su stucklogin</em><a name="IXT-5-7335" /> command (if the stuck account uses
Bourne-type shells) or the <em class="emphasis">su -f
stucklogin</em><a name="IXT-5-7336" /> <a name="IXT-5-7337" /> <a name="IXT-5-7338" /> <a name="IXT-5-7339" /> command (if the stuck account uses
<i class="command">csh</i> or <i class="command">tcsh</i>). Change
(<i class="command">cd </i>) to the home directory. Rename the
account's setup files so the shell
won't see them as you log in. (If you have <b class="emphasis-bold">superuser access</b> (<a href="ch01_18.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-18">Section 1.18</a>), you also can use it to rename the
file.)<a href="#FOOTNOTE-18">[18]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-18" /><p> [18]Note that there is no user named
<em class="emphasis">stucklogin</em>; you're expected to
supply the actual login username as an argument to
<i class="command">su</i>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>If you can log in after that, you know that the problem is with the
account's setup files.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Set shell debugging</b>
(<a name="IXT-5-7340" /><a name="IXT-5-7341" /><a href="ch27_15.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-15">Section 27.15</a>) on the stuck account's setup
files. From another account or as the superuser, start an editor and
put the following line at the top of an <i class="command">sh</i>-like
setup file (such as <em class="filename">.profile</em>).
<a name="IXT-5-7342" />It'll tell you whether
<em class="filename">.profile</em> is being read at all and where it
hangs:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">set -xv</pre></blockquote>

<p>You'll see each line read from the
<em class="filename">.profile</em> and the commands executed on the
screen. If you don't see anything, then the shell
probably didn't read <em class="filename">.profile</em>.
Bash users would want to check<a name="IXT-5-7343" /> <em class="filename">.bashrc</em> or
<em class="filename">.bash_profile</em>.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7344" /> <a name="IXT-5-7345" />C-shell users should put this command
at the top of <em class="filename">.cshrc</em><a name="IXT-5-7346" /> <a name="IXT-5-7347" /> (or <em class="filename">.tcshrc</em>, for
<i class="command">tcsh</i>) instead:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">set echo verbose</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that on many Unix systems, the shell won't read
its startup files if the files aren't owned by you.
You might use <a name="IXT-5-7348" /><b class="emphasis-bold">ls -l</b> (<a href="ch50_02.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-2">Section 50.2</a>) to check.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Look at the entry in the <b class="emphasis-bold">/etc/passwd</b>
<b class="emphasis-bold">file</b> (<a href="ch22_03.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-3">Section 22.3</a>)
for this user. <a name="IXT-5-7349" /><a name="IXT-5-7350" />Be sure it has the correct number of
fields (separated by :). Also, see if there's
another user with the same login name. (If your system has commands
like <i class="command">useradd</i>, <i class="command">linuxconf</i>, or
<i class="command">vipw</i>(8) and <i class="command">pwck</i>(8), using them
to edit and check the <em class="filename">passwd</em> file will avoid
many of these problems, as those programs perform sanity checks on
any modifications you make before taking them live.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="IXT-5-7351" /><a name="IXT-5-7352" />Does your
account use any <b class="emphasis-bold">directories remotely mounted
(by NFS)</b> (<a name="IXT-5-7353" /><a href="ch01_21.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 1.21</a>)?
If the remote host or network is down and any command in your startup
files (especially <em class="emphasis">set
path</em><a name="IXT-5-7354" /><a name="IXT-5-7355" />) tries to access those
directories, the shell may hang there.
</p>

<p>To fix that problem, <i class="command">su</i> to the account as
explained earlier, and take the command or directory name out of your
startup file. Or, if this problem happens a lot, the system
administrator can mount an <a name="IXT-5-7356" /><a name="IXT-5-7357" />NFS filesystem
"soft" (instead of
"hard," the default) and limit the
number of retrys.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>What looks like a "hang" might also
be that you just aren't getting any output to the
terminal, for some very weird reason. Then the <em class="emphasis">set
-xv</em><a name="IXT-5-7358" /> wouldn't help
you. In that case, try adding this line to the start of the
<em class="filename">.profile</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">exec &gt; /tmp/sh.out.$$ 2&gt;&amp;1</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7359" />If the Bourne shell starts
reading <em class="filename">.profile</em>, it'll make a
file in <em class="filename">/tmp</em> called
<tt class="literal">sh.out</tt>.<em class="replaceable"><tt>nnn</tt></em> with output
from the commands and the shell's
<i class="command">set</i> -<span class="option">xv</span>.
</p>

<p>There's no command like that for the C shell or
<i class="command">tcsh</i>.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Here are a few more tips for dealing with stuck terminals.</p>

<a name="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.1. Output Stopped?</h3>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7360" /><a name="IXT-5-7361" /><a name="IXT-5-7362" />If your terminal has a HOLD SCREEN or
SCROLL LOCK button, did you accidentally press it? Try pressing it
and see if things start working again. If pressing the button once
doesn't fix the problem, you should probably press
it once more to undo the screen hold. Otherwise, you may lock up your
session worse than it was before!
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7363" /> <a name="IXT-5-7364" />Another way to stop output is by
pressing CTRL-s. The way to restart stopped output is with
<a name="IXT-5-7365" />CTRL-q -- try pressing that now.
(Unlike a SCROLL LOCK button, though, if CTRL-q
doesn't help, you don't need to
undo it.)
</p>

</div>
<a name="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.2. Job Stopped?</h3>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7366" /> <a name="IXT-5-7367" />If you're at a shell
prompt instead of in the program you thought you were
running -- and if your Unix has job control -- you may have
stopped a job. <b class="emphasis-bold">Try the</b> <b class="emphasis-bold">jobs</b> <b class="emphasis-bold">command</b>
(<a href="ch23_01.htm#upt3-CHP-23-SECT-1">Section 23.1</a>); if the job is stopped, restart it.
</p>

</div>
<a name="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-6.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.3. Program Waiting for Input?</h3>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7368" /> <a name="IXT-5-7369" />The program may be waiting for you to
answer a question or type text to its standard input.
</p>

<a name="ch05-2-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>WARNING:</b> 
If the program you were running does something
that's hard to undo -- like removing
files -- <em class="emphasis">don't</em> try this step
unless you've thought about it carefully.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7370" /><a name="IXT-5-7371" />If your system has job control, you
can find out by putting the job in the background with CTRL-z and
<i class="command">bg</i>. If the job was waiting for input,
you'll see the message:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[1]  + Stopped (tty input)  grep pat</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can bring the job back into the foreground and answer its
question, if you know what that question is. Otherwise, now that the
job is stopped, you can kill it. See the following directions.
</p>

<p>On systems without job control, you might satisfy the program by
pressing RETURN or some other key that the program is expecting, like
<em class="emphasis">y</em> or <em class="emphasis">n</em>. You could also try
pressing CTRL-d or whatever your "end of
input" character is set to. That might log you out,
though, unless you've set the
<em class="emphasis">ignoreeof</em> variable.
</p>

</div>
<a name="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-6.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.4. Stalled Data Connection?</h3>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7372" /> <a name="IXT-5-7373" /><a name="IXT-5-7374" />Be sure that the wires
haven't come loose.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7375" /><a name="IXT-5-7376" /><a name="IXT-5-7377" />If you're using a
modem and the modem has function lights, try pressing keys to see if
the Send Data (SD) light flashes. If it does, your terminal is
sending data to the host computer. If the Receive Data (RD) light
flashes, the computer is sending data to your terminal. If you
don't see anything, there might be something wrong
on your terminal.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7378" /><a name="IXT-5-7379" /><a name="IXT-5-7380" />If you're connected with
<b class="emphasis-bold">rlogin</b> <b class="emphasis-bold">or</b> <b class="emphasis-bold">telnet</b>
<b class="emphasis-bold">or</b> <b class="emphasis-bold">ssh</b> (<a href="ch01_21.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 1.21</a>), the
network to the remote computer might be down or really slow. Try
opening another connection to the same remote host -- if you get a
response like <tt class="literal">Connection</tt> <tt class="literal">timed</tt>
<tt class="literal">out</tt>, you have two choices:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Wait for your original connection to unfreeze. The connection may
come back and let you keep working where you left off. Or the
connection may end when <i class="command">rlogin</i>,
<i class="command">telnet,</i> or <i class="command">ssh </i>notices the
network problem.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Quit the session, and try again later.</p>
</li></ol>

<a name="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-6.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.5. Aborting Programs</h3>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7381" /><a name="IXT-5-7382" /><a name="IXT-5-7383" /><a name="IXT-5-7384" />To abort a program, most users press
CTRL-c. Your account may be set up to use a different interrupt
character, such as DELETE. If this doesn't work, try
CTRL-\ (CTRL-backslash). Under most circumstances, this will force
the program to terminate. Otherwise, do the following:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Log in at another terminal or window.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="IXT-5-7385" />Enter the command
<tt class="literal">ps</tt> <tt class="literal">x</tt>, or, if that
doesn't work, use <tt class="literal">ps</tt>
<tt class="literal">-u</tt> <em class="replaceable"><tt>yourname</tt></em>, where
<em class="replaceable"><tt>yourname</tt></em> is your Unix username. This
displays a list of the programs you are running, something like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ps x</b></tt>
PID     TTY     STAT    TIME    COMMAND
163     i26     I       0:41    -csh (csh)
8532    i26     TW      2:17    vi ts.ms
22202   i26     S       12:50   vi UNIXintro.ms
8963    pb      R       0:00    ps -x
24077   pb      S       0:05    -bin/csh (csh)
%</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>Search through this list to find the command that has backfired. Note
the process identification (PID) number for this command.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a name="IXT-5-7386" />Enter the command <b class="emphasis-bold">kill PID</b> (<a href="ch24_12.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-12">Section 24.12</a>), where
<em class="emphasis">PID</em> is the identification number from the
previous step. If that doesn't work, try
<tt class="literal">kill -1</tt> <em class="replaceable"><tt>PID</tt></em> to send a
HUP signal. You can also try various other signals, including
<tt class="literal">-2</tt> or <tt class="literal">-15</tt>. If none of them
work, you may need <em class="emphasis">kill -9</em>, but try the other
<i class="command">kill</i>s first.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the Unix shell prompt (such as <tt class="literal">%</tt> or
<tt class="literal">$</tt>) has appeared at your original terminal, things
are probably back to normal. You may still have to take the terminal
out of a strange mode though.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-5-7387" /><a name="IXT-5-7388" />If the shell prompt
hasn't come back, find the shell associated with
your terminal (identified by a tty number), and
<i class="command">kill</i> it. The command name for the C shell is
<i class="command">csh</i>. For the Bourne shell, it is
<i class="command">sh</i>. In most cases, this will destroy any other
commands running from your terminal. Be sure to
<i class="command">kill</i> the shell on your own terminal, not the
terminal you borrowed to enter these commands. The tty you borrowed
is the one running <i class="command">ps</i>; look at the previous
example and check the <tt class="literal">TTY</tt> column. In this case,
the borrowed terminal is TTY pb.
</p>

<p>Check <i class="command">ps</i> to ensure that your shell has died. If it
is still there, take more drastic action with the command
<tt class="literal">kill -9</tt><em class="replaceable"><tt>PID</tt></em>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Run <tt class="literal">ps x</tt> or <tt class="literal">ps -u</tt>
<em class="replaceable"><tt>yourname</tt></em> again to be sure that all
processes on the other tty have died. (In some cases, processes will
remain.) If there are still processes on the other tty, kill them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>At this point, you should be able to log in again from your own
terminal.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The <b class="emphasis-bold">ps</b> (<a href="ch24_05.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-5">Section 24.5</a>) command, which lists some or all of the
programs you are running, also gives you useful information about the
status of each program and the amount of CPU time it has
consumed.<a name="IXTR3-7512" />
