<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />46.1. TCP/IP -- IP Addresses and Ports</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-7332" />TCP/IP
<a name="upt3-IDXTERM-7333" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-7334" />networking is a part of the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) Model. <a name="IXT-46-439" />Much like you
can string together lots of little single-purpose Unix tools to do
complex tasks, the OSI Model is made up of specific single-purpose
layers that work together. Each layer builds on the layers below.
Layers 1 and 2 are concerned with hardware; physical standards such
as required voltages and low-level protocols like Ethernet reside
there. Layers 3 and 4 are networking layers, which this article
introduces. Layers 5 through 7 are application layers, where
networking interfaces such as BSD sockets and applications such as
web browsers, telnet clients, and diagnostic tools live.
</p>

<p>For most Unixes, the fundamentals of networking (once you get past
the network device drivers) are the <a name="IXT-46-440" /><a name="IXT-46-441" />Layer
3 Internet Protocol (IP) and a <a name="IXT-46-442" />Layer 4 protocol on top of it, either
the <a name="IXT-46-443" /><a name="IXT-46-444" />Transport Control Protocol (TCP), the
<a name="IXT-46-445" /> <a name="IXT-46-446" /><a name="IXT-46-447" /> <a name="IXT-46-448" />User
Datagram Protocol (UDP), or the IP Control Message Protocol (ICMP).
These four protocols are so commonly treated as one unit that
you'll often see them referred to together as
TCP/IP.
</p>

<a name="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">46.1.1. Internet Protocol (IP)</h3>

<p>IP's job is to get small chunks of data, called
<a name="IXT-46-449" />packets, from one
machine to another. It is a "best
effort" protocol; that is, it makes its best effort
to deliver each packet to the right host, and if it
can't, it simply drops the packet on the floor. It
may seem like losing bits of your data would be a bad thing, but it
turns out that this feature is part of what allows the Internet to
route traffic around problems; higher-level protocols and
applications notice that packets are being dropped and resend them,
sometimes through better routes.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-46-450" /><a name="IXT-46-451" />IP
identifies machines through <em class="emphasis">IP
addresses</em><a name="IXT-46-452" />. Every
machine that wants to communicate with another machine via TCP/IP
must have a unique IP address, unless it's using
<b class="emphasis-bold">Network Address Translation (NAT)</b>
(<a name="IXT-46-453" /><a name="IXT-46-454" /><a href="ch46_01.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1">Section 46.1</a>). When you
dial up your ISP with a modem, your ISP assigns you a
<a name="IXT-46-455" />dynamic
IP address, good for that modem session. When you have a dedicated
broadband connection, often your ISP will assign you a small block of
<a name="IXT-46-456" />static
IP addresses to use as you like. Each ISP is in turn assigned large
blocks of IP addresses for them to dole out to their users, and
traffic on the Internet travels from ISP to ISP based on the
addresses they hold.
</p>

<p>The current standard version of <a name="IXT-46-457" />IP is Version 4 (IPv4), which uses
32-bit addresses. With the explosion of the Internet, addresses are
being used up at quite an impressive rate; remember that normally
every single machine connected to the Internet needs its own
<a name="IXT-46-458" />IP address. Version 6 (IPv6) is, at the
time of this writing, a proposed standard that uses 128-bit
addresses. For the purposes of this book, we'll
gloss over the differences, since they mostly don't
matter at this level. Our examples will use IPv4 addresses, since
that's what you're most likely to
be dealing with for a little while yet.
</p>

<a name="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">46.1.2. Layer 4 Protocols: TCP, UDP, and ICMP</h3>

<p><a name="IXT-46-459" /><a name="IXT-46-460" /> <a name="IXT-46-461" /> <a name="IXT-46-462" /> <a name="IXT-46-463" />TCP, UDP, and ICMP all
"sit on top" of IP; that is, they
use IP to actually deliver the packets.
</p>

<p>TCP's job is to provide ordered and guaranteed
delivery. Ordered delivery means that the application at the other
end of the TCP connection reads data in the same order as it was
sent. Guaranteed delivery means that TCP keeps track of which packets
arrived at the other end and resends packets that were dropped.
Together, these two characteristics provide a network communication
mechanism that acts very much like a Unix pipe from an
application's point of view; you simply write bytes
in one end and they come out the other. Many common network
applications sit on top of TCP and use these services, including
telnet, HTTP servers and web browsers, <b class="emphasis-bold">SSH</b> (<a href="ch46_06.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-6">Section 46.6</a>), and
<b class="emphasis-bold">email</b> (<a href="ch46_08.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-8">Section 46.8</a>). 
</p>

<p>UDP provides application access to the basic delivery mechanism of IP
and adds port addressing (see below). Some applications
don't need guaranteed delivery and want the lower
overhead of UDP, or want the low-level control of network error
recovery UDP can provide, or need to be able to do certain kinds of
broadcast. Services like <b class="emphasis-bold">DNS</b> (<a href="ch46_09.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-9">Section 46.9</a>) and <b class="emphasis-bold">DHCP</b>
(<a href="ch46_10.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-10">Section 46.10</a>) use UDP rather than TCP, as do many
Internet games.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-46-464" />Both TCP and UDP provide addressing of
their own above and beyond IP addresses; these addresses are called
<em class="emphasis">ports</em><a name="IXT-46-465" /> <a name="IXT-46-466" />. Generally,
simply getting a packet to a machine isn't quite
enough; if you want two programs to communicate, they need a
rendezvous point; there can be a lot of programs running on the
destination machine, and TCP and UDP need to know to which program
packets should be delivered. An IP address and a port provide the
means for two programs to hook up and start talking. Every
communication needs a port on each machine; one side
"listens" on a well-known port and
the other side "connects" to that
port, generating a random port of its own.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-46-467" />Ports are represented by an integer
number. Ports below 1024 are usually accessible only by programs
running as root and are thus mostly reserved for system services and
the like. <b class="emphasis-bold">/etc/services</b> (<a href="ch46_02.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-2">Section 46.2</a>) lists most of the well-known ports used by
the main system services.
</p>

<p>Finally, <a name="IXT-46-468" />ICMP provides diagnostic and traffic
control messages. ICMP is primarily used by applications such as
<b class="emphasis-bold">ping and traceroute</b> (<a href="ch46_04.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-4">Section 46.4</a>) to diagnose problems, check network status,
and the like. Routers can also use ICMP to control traffic.
