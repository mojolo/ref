<h2 class="sect1">1.6. There Are Many Shells</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1173" />With most
<a name="IXT-1-1174" />operating systems, the
command intepreter is built in; it is an integral part of the
operating system. With Unix, your command interpreter is just another
program. Traditionally, a command interpreter is called a
"shell," perhaps because it
protects you from the underlying kernel -- or because it protects
the kernel from you!
</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, the most common shells were the Bourne shell
(<i class="command">sh</i>) and the C shell (<i class="command">csh</i>).
<a name="IXT-1-1175" />The
<b class="emphasis-bold">Bourne shell</b> (<a href="ch03_03.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 3.3</a>) (named after its creator, Steve Bourne) came
first. It was excellent for <b class="emphasis-bold">shell
programming</b> (<a href="ch01_08.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-8">Section 1.8</a>). But many Unix
users (who were also writing programs in the <a name="IXT-1-1176" /><a name="IXT-1-1177" />C language) wanted
a more familiar programming syntax -- as well as more features for
interactive use. So the C shell came from Berkeley as part of their
Unix implementation. Soon (on systems that gave you the choice, at
least) <i class="command">csh</i> was much more popular for interactive
use than <i class="command">sh</i>. The C shell had a lot of nice
features that weren't available in the original
Bourne shell, including <b class="emphasis-bold">job control</b>
(<a href="ch23_01.htm#upt3-CHP-23-SECT-1">Section 23.1</a>) and <b class="emphasis-bold">history</b> (<a href="ch30_02.htm#upt3-CHP-30-SECT-2">Section 30.2</a>).
However, it wasn't hard for a shell programmer or an
advanced user to push the C shell to its limits.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1178" /><a name="IXT-1-1179" /> <a name="IXT-1-1180" /> <a name="IXT-1-1181" />The Korn shell (also named after its
creator, David Korn) arrived in the mid-1980s. The
<i class="command">ksh</i> is compatible with the Bourne shell, but has
most of the C shell's features plus features like
<b class="emphasis-bold">history editing</b> (<a href="ch30_14.htm#upt3-CHP-30-SECT-14">Section 30.14</a>), often called <em class="emphasis">command-line
editing</em>. The Korn shell was available only with a
proprietary version of Unix, System V -- but now a
<a name="IXT-1-1182" /> <a name="IXT-1-1183" />public-domain version
named <i class="command">pdksh</i> is widely available.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1184" /><a name="IXT-1-1185" /><a name="IXT-1-1186" />These days, most original C shell users have
probably switched to <i class="command">tcsh</i> (pronounced
"T-shell"). It has all the features
of <i class="command">csh</i> and more -- as well as fewer
mis-features and outright bugs.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1187" /><a name="IXT-1-1188" />The
"Bourne-again" shell,
<i class="command">bash</i>, is from the Free Software Foundation.
It's fairly similar to the Korn shell. It has most
of the C shell's features, plus command-line editing
and a built-in help command. The programming syntax, though, is much
more like the original Bourne shell -- and many systems (including
<a name="IXT-1-1189" />Linux) use <i class="command">bash</i> in
place of the original Bourne shell (but still call it
<i class="command">sh</i>).
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1190" /><a name="IXT-1-1191" />The Z
shell, <i class="command">zsh</i>, is an interesting hybrid. It tries to
be compatible with most features of all the other shells, with
compatibility modes and a slew of options that turn off conflicting
features. In its soul, though, <i class="command">zsh</i> has a different
way of doing some things. It's been accused of
feature creep. But <i class="command">zsh</i> users love its flexibility.
</p>

<p>There are other shells. <a name="IXT-1-1192" /> <a name="IXT-1-1193" /><a name="IXT-1-1194" /><a name="IXT-1-1195" />If you're a fan of the
Bell Labs research operating system named <em class="emphasis">Plan 9</em>
(actually, <em class="emphasis">Plan 9 from Outer Space</em>),
you'll be happy to know that its shell,
<i class="command">rc</i>, has been ported to Unix. If you program in
Tcl, you'll probably be familiar with
<i class="command">tclsh</i><a name="IXT-1-1196" />, which lets you intermix Unix commands
with Tcl commands. (And we can't forget
<i class="command">wish</i><a name="IXT-1-1197" /> <a name="IXT-1-1198" />, the shell that's a
superset of <i class="command">tclsh</i>: it uses Tcl/Tk commands to let
you build graphical interfaces as you go.) Least -- but certainly
not last -- if you're a minimalist who needs the
original <i class="command">sh</i>, a newer shell named
<i class="command">ash</i><a name="IXT-1-1199" /> emulates the late-1980s Bourne shell.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1200" /><a name="IXT-1-1201" />In this
book, we try to be as generic as we can. Where we need to get
specific, many examples are shown in the style of both the Bourne
shell and the C shell -- for instance, we'll
often show Bourne-shell functions side-by-side with C-shell aliases.
Because <i class="command">bash</i> and <i class="command">ksh</i> can read
scripts written for the original Bourne shell, we use original
<i class="command">sh</i> syntax to make our shell programming as
portable as possible.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-1-1202" /> <a name="IXT-1-1203" />Where
we talk about "the Bourne shell" or
<i class="command">sh</i>, it's usually a safe bet that
the information applies to <i class="command">bash</i> and
<i class="command">ksh</i> too. In the same way, "the C
shell" generally also means <i class="command">tcsh</i>.
