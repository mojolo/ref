<h2 class="sect1">42.10. What About Perl?</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-42-2440" /><a name="IXT-42-2441" /> <a name="IXT-42-2442" />Comparing
languages can generate a lot of heat and very little light. However,
"Why not just use Perl?" is such a
common question that I'll try to provide at least a
basic understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of
Python versus Perl. Remember that you can write good code or bad code
in pretty much any language, but understanding whether your tool is
best at driving nails or screws is always useful.
</p>

<p>Perl's driving motto is
"There's more than one way to do
it." Because of this priority and the huge archive
of Perl modules on CPAN, Perl is an incredibly useful tool for
building quick one-off scripts or hacking together tools in a very
short time. However, it also means that it's very
easy to write Perl code that will be impenetrable six months down the
road. Perl provides very little assistance to someone who wants to
write complex systems clearly. Features like <tt class="literal">perl</tt>
<tt class="literal">-w</tt> (warnings), <tt class="literal">use strict</tt>, and
Perl's module support help maintainability, but it
still requires a great deal of care and discipline.
</p>

<p>Python's support for maintainability, on the other
hand, is excellent. Python's rich collection of
modules and the fact that it's an interpreted
language allow relatively fast development, if not quite as fast as
in Perl. Generally, the more complex the system
you're trying to build and the longer you expect to
use it, the more potential there is for gain in using Python over
Perl.
</p>

<p>Personally, when tossing together quick one-offs or scripts that are
very regular expression-heavy, I use Perl. Perl's
regular expression support is so fundamental to the language that
it's worth it, and its Swiss-Army-knife nature is
perfect for things I don't expect to need again
later. I also tend to use Perl when I want to write a very portable
script, as most Unixes include Perl as part of the base system these
days, whereas Python, while just as portable, tends to need to be
installed seperately. When I want to build more complex scripts or
larger systems, and maintainability is thus a higher priority, I use
Python. I often use Python even for smaller things if I intend to
keep them around for a while.
</p>

<p>In the end, of course, it comes down to a matter of personal taste
and judgment. Personally, I value being able to understand my code
six months (or six years!) down the road far more than having every
tool imaginable at my fingertips, so I tend to lean towards languages
that help you write clear, readable code, like Python.
