<h2 class="sect1">6.4. X Event Translations</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1142" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1143" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1144" />This article introduces event
translations, which are special X Window System resources that
control actions of things like mouse clicks. <a href="ch06_03.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-3">Section 6.3</a> introduces X resources and shows their syntax.
<a href="ch06_05.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-5">Section 6.5</a> through <a href="ch06_09.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-9">Section 6.9</a> explain how to set and check
resources -- as you log in and after.
</p>

<p>We've discussed the basics of resource-naming
syntax. From the sample resource settings, it appears that what many
resource variables do is self-evident or nearly so. Among the less
obvious resource variables, there is one type of specification, an
event translation, that can be used with many clients and warrants
somewhat closer examination.
</p>

<p>User input and several other types of information pass from the
server to a client in the form of
<em class="emphasis">events</em><a name="IXT-6-874" />.
An event is a packet of information that gives the client something
to act on, such as keyboard input. Moving the pointer or pressing a
key causes <em class="emphasis">input</em><a name="IXT-6-875" /> events to occur. When a program receives
a meaningful event, it responds with some sort of action.
</p>

<p>For many clients, the resource manager recognizes mappings between
certain input events (such as a pointer button click) and some sort
of action by the client program (such as selecting text). A mapping
between one or more events and an action is called a
<em class="emphasis">translation</em>. A resource containing a list of
translations is called a <em class="emphasis">translation table</em>.
<a name="IXT-6-876" /> <a name="IXT-6-877" />
</p>

<p>Many event translations are programmed into an application and are
invisible to the user.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-28">[28]</a> For our purposes we are only
concerned with very visible translations of certain input events,
primarily the translation of keystrokes and pointer button clicks to
particular actions by a client program.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-28" /><p> [28]For more information on events
and translations, see O'Reilly &amp;
Associates' <em class="citetitle">X Window System Guide,
</em>Volume 4.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The operation of many clients, notably <i class="command">xterm</i>, is
partly determined by default input event translations. For example,
selecting text with the first pointer button (an event) saves that
text into memory (an action).
</p>

<p>In this case, the input "event" is
actually three separate X events:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Pressing the first pointer button.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Moving the pointer while holding down the first button.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-29">[29]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-29" /><p> [29]Actually, if there is no text to select, motion is recorded as
a series of <em class="emphasis">MotionNotify</em> events.</p>
</blockquote>
</li><li>
<p>Releasing the button.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Each of these input events performs a part of the action of selecting
text:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Unselects any previously selected text and begins selecting new text.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Extends the selection.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ends the selection, saving the text into memory (both as the primary
selection and CUT_BUFFER0).
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The event and action mappings would be expressed in a translation
table as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: select-start( )\n\
&lt;Btn1Motion&gt;: select-extend( )\n\
&lt;Btn1Up&gt;: select-end(primary,CUT_BUFFER0)</pre></blockquote>

<p>where each <a name="IXT-6-878" /> <a name="IXT-6-879" />event is enclosed in angle brackets
(&lt;&gt;) and produces the action that follows the colon (:). A
space or TAB generally precedes the action, though this is not
mandatory:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;event&gt;: action</pre></blockquote>

<p>A translation table must be a continuous string. To link multiple
mappings as a continuous string, each event-action line should be
terminated by a
<a name="IXT-6-880" />newline character
(<tt class="literal">\n</tt>), which is in turn followed by a backslash
(<tt class="literal">\</tt>) to escape the actual newline.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-6-881" /><a name="IXT-6-882" />These are default
translations for <i class="command">xterm</i>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-30">[30]</a> All of the
events are simple, comprised of a single button motion. As
we'll see, events can also have modifiers: i.e.,
additional button motions or keystrokes (often CTRL or Meta) that
must be performed with the primary event to produce the action.
(Events can also have modifiers that <em class="emphasis">must not</em>
accompany the primary event if the action is to take place.)
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-30" /><p> [30]They are
actually slightly simplified versions of default translations. Before
you can understand the actual translations listed in the
<i class="command">xterm</i> manual page, you must learn more about the
syntax of translations. We cover the basics here; for more
information, see O'Reilly &amp;
Associates' <em class="citetitle">X Window System Guide,
</em>Volume 3M, Appendix F.</p> </blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the default actions of keysym mappings are hardly
intuitive. The client's manpage usually lists the
event-action mappings that you can modify.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-6-883" /> <a name="IXT-6-884" />You can specify nondefault
translations using a translation table (a resource containing a list
of translations). Since actions are part of the client application
and cannot be modified, you are actually specifying alternative
events to perform an action.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-31">[31]</a> Keep in mind
that only applications written with the X Toolkit (or an Xt-based
toolkit such as the Motif Toolkit) recognize translation-table syntax
as described here.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-31" /><p> [31]As
we'll see, in certain cases you may be able to
supply an alternative <em class="emphasis">argument</em> (such as a
selection name) to an action. These changes <em class="emphasis">are</em>
interpreted by the resource manager.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The basic syntax for specifying a <a name="IXT-6-885" />translation table as a resource is as
follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[<em class="replaceable"><tt>object</em>*[<em class="replaceable">subobject</tt></em>...]]*translations:   #override\
        [<em class="replaceable"><tt>modifier</em>]&lt;<em class="replaceable">event</em>&gt;:   <em class="replaceable">action</tt></em></pre></blockquote>

<p>The first line is basically like any other resource specification
with a few exceptions. First, the final
<em class="replaceable"><tt>argument</tt></em> is always
<tt class="literal">translations</tt>, indicating that one (or more) of the
event-action bindings associated with the
[<em class="replaceable"><tt>object</em><tt class="literal">*</tt>[<em class="replaceable">subobject</tt></em><tt class="literal">..</tt>.]]
are being modified.
</p>

<p>Second, note that <tt class="literal">#override</tt> is not the
<em class="replaceable"><tt>value</tt></em> of the resource; it is literal and
indicates that what follows should override any default translations.
In effect, <tt class="literal">#override</tt> is no more than a pointer to
the true <em class="replaceable"><tt>value</tt></em> of the resource: a new
event-action mapping (on the following line) where the event may take
a modifier.
</p>

<p>A not-so-obvious principle behind overriding translations is that you
only literally "override" a default
translation when the event(s) of the new translation match the
event(s) of a default translation <em class="emphasis">exactly</em>. If
the new translation does not conflict with any existing translation,
it is merely appended to the defaults.
</p>

<p>To be specified as a resource, a translation table must be a single
string. The <tt class="literal">#override</tt> is followed by a backslash
(<tt class="literal">\</tt>) to indicate that the subsequent line should be
a continuation of the first.
</p>

<p>In the previous basic syntax example, the
<em class="replaceable"><tt>value</tt></em> is a single event-action mapping.
The <em class="replaceable"><tt>value</tt></em> could also be a list of several
mappings, linked by the characters <tt class="literal">\n\</tt> to make the
resource a continuous string.
</p>

<p>The following <i class="command">xterm</i> translation table shows
multiple event-action mappings linked in this <a name="IXTR3-966" /> <a name="IXTR3-967" /> <a name="IXTR3-968" />manner:
<a name="IXT-6-886" />
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">*VT100.Translations:   #override\
        &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:    select-start( )\n\
        &lt;Btn1Motion&gt;:  select-extend( )\n\
        &lt;Btn1Up&gt;:      select-end(primary,CUT_BUFFER0)</pre></blockquote>
