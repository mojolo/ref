<h2 class="sect1">41.11. CPAN</h2>

<p>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN), whose URL is
<a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>, is the place
to get modules, scripts, and the Perl source code. This system is
mirrored all over the world, so consult <a href="http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a> or <a href="http://mirror.cpan.org">http://mirror.cpan.org</a> for the server nearest
you. There is a really complete CPAN FAQ that can be found at
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html">http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html</a>.
</p>

<p>This section covers obtaining and installing modules from CPAN. If
your installation of Perl is up to date, module installation is
trivial. If you've got a
"unique" system, you may need to
take matters into your own hands.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">41.11.1. Installing Modules the Easy Way</h3>

<p>In a fit of inspired genius (or madness), the CPAN module was created
to automate the task of fetching and installing modules. If you want
to install the Text::AutoFormat suite, it's as easy
as becoming superuser on your system and typing:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># perl -MCPAN -e 'install Text::AutoFormat'</pre></blockquote>

<p>Perl has many command-line switches. Here, <tt class="literal">-M</tt>
(equivalent to <tt class="literal">use</tt>
<em class="replaceable"><tt>module</tt></em>) and <tt class="literal">-e</tt> (execute
the next argument as <em class="emphasis">perl</em> code) are used. If
you've never run the CPAN module before, be prepared
to answer a lot of questions about your network setup and where
certain system binaries are. Luckily, you can usually accept the
defaults safely. Once that's done, the CPAN module
will go to the CPAN mirror you specified; find the latest version of
the module you asked for; and download, unpack, configure, and
install it for you with no additional typing. Now
that's twenty-first-century library management! If
your module depends on other modules not installed on your system,
CPAN will attempt to fetch and install the missing modules. In fact,
you can update the CPAN module itself with:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::CPAN'</pre></blockquote>

<p>The CPAN module also has an interactive shell you can access like
this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ perl -MCPAN -e shell</pre></blockquote>

<p>Why bother with the interactive shell? Sometimes you want to install
several unrelated modules at once. This is done more conveniently in
the CPAN shell. Alternately, you may want only to download module
archives without actualling installing them. The entire range of
shell options can be found with the <tt class="literal">h</tt> command
inside the shell. One of the most useful shell functions, the search
function, can be used to look up available CPAN modules. For
instance:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell

cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.59)
ReadLine support enabled

cpan&gt; i /Text/
CPAN: Storable loaded ok
Going to read /usr/local/cpan/Metadata
Module          AddressBook::DB::Text (D/DL/DLEIGH/AddressBook-0.16.tar.gz)
Module          AnyData::Format::Text (J/JZ/JZUCKER/AnyData-0.05.tar.gz)
Module          Apache::PrettyText (C/CH/CHTHORMAN/Apache-PrettyText-1.03...
...

401 items found
cpan&gt; quit</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here, we use the <tt class="literal">i</tt> command to search for the
regular expression <tt class="literal">/Text/</tt> in all the module names.
</p>

<p>When you first run the CPAN module, you will be asked a series of
configuration questions. The first question you'll
be asked when configuring CPAN is to name a CPAN build and cache
directory (where CPAN unpacks fetched module archives and builds
them). Put this in a sensible place where you and other users can can
get to it, such as <em class="filename">/usr/local/cpan</em>.
You'll be asked to name the maximum size for the
cache directory (the default is 10MB). The next question will ask
when to perform size checks on the cache, <tt class="literal">atstart</tt>
or <tt class="literal">never</tt>. Unless you have a compelling reason not
to remove old module builds, accept the default of
<tt class="literal">atstart</tt>. You then be asked whether CPAN metadata
should be cached, and again, accept the default of
<tt class="literal">yes</tt>.
</p>

<p>The next question asks about what character set your terminal
expects. Again, you should accept the default of
<tt class="literal">yes</tt>. The configuration then asks what it should do
when unfulfilled dependencies are encountered during a module
installation. CPAN can automatically fetch the missing modules
(<tt class="literal">follow</tt>), ask for confirmation before downloading
them (<tt class="literal">ask</tt>), or do nothing
(<tt class="literal">ignore</tt>). If you are on a fast Internet
connection, you may want to set the policy to
<tt class="literal">follow</tt>. The safest policy, and one that guards
against runaway module fetching sessions, is <tt class="literal">ask</tt>.
</p>

<p>The next several questions ask for the location of certain binaries
(like <i class="command">lynx</i>, <i class="command">make</i>,
<i class="command">gzip</i>, etc.). Answer these appropriately. The next
set of questions ask for additional <i class="command">make</i>
parameters. Again, accept the defaults. You will then be asked about
your network setup. If you are behind a firewall that uses SOCKs or
proxy servers for FTP and HTTP, you will need to enter those server
names. CPAN will ask you to pick a CPAN mirror closest to you, by
asking you for continent and country information.
You'll be presented with a list of CPAN mirrors, and
you can enter the numbers of the URLs in which you are interested.
Generally, you'll only need to give one or two
mirrors. The last question is about the WAIT system, to which you can
safely accept the default. This concludes the CPAN configuration.

<h3 class="sect2">41.11.2. Installing Modules the Hard Way</h3>

<p>Most modules on CPAN are gzipped <i class="command">tar</i> archives that
have some common files in them that makes installing them fairly
simple. To install a CPAN module, unpack your archive and
<em class="emphasis">cd</em> to the new directory that was just created.
Now type:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make test</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is a similiar configure and compile idiom to the one shown in
<a href="ch41_03.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-3">Section 41.3</a>. If the tests all succeed, change to
root and install the module with:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># make install</pre></blockquote>

<p>The module is now available to your system.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">41.11.3. Browsing the CPAN Web Site</h3>

<p>There's something to be said for browsing the CPAN
archive with a web browser. In fact, there are all kinds of ancillary
tidbits that are available only on the web site. However,
CPAN's main purpose is to store and serve modules.
</p>

<p>Modules on CPAN are arranged by author name, module name, category,
and recentness. Of these, module name and category are perhaps the
most useful for CPAN newbies. The full Perl documentation is linked
to from CPAN, but you should have this on your system already. Of
course, no serious web site these days is missing a search engine,
and CPAN is no exception. In fact, the search engine has its own URL:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>. This is
an excellent resource for quickly finding modules that may solve your
problem.
</p>

<p>CPAN is an ocean of code that awaits your exploration.</p>
