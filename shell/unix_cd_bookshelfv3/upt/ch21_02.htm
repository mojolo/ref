<h2 class="sect1">21.2. Neatening Text with fmt</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-21-5644" /> <a name="IXT-21-5645" />One of <a name="IXT-21-5646" />the problems
with <i class="command">fold</i><a name="IXT-21-5647" /> is that it breaks text at an arbitrary
column position -- even if that position happens to be in the
middle of a word. It's a pretty primitive utility,
designed to keep long lines from printing off the edge of a line
printer page, and not much more.
</p>

<p><i class="command">fmt</i> can do a better job because it thinks in terms
of language constructs like <a name="IXT-21-5648" />paragraphs.
<i class="command">fmt</i> wraps lines continuously, rather than just
folding the long ones. It assumes that paragraphs end at blank lines.
</p>

<p>You can use <i class="command">fmt</i> for things like neatening lines of
a mail message or a file that you're editing
<b class="emphasis-bold">with</b> <b class="emphasis-bold">vi</b> (<a href="ch17_28.htm#upt3-CHP-17-SECT-28">Section 17.28</a>). (Emacs has
its own built-in line-neatener.) It's also great for
shell programming and almost any place you have lines that are too
long or too short for your screen.
</p>

<p>To make this discussion more concrete, let's imagine
that you have the following paragraph:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">    Most people take their  Emo Phillips  for granted.  They figure, and not
without some truth, that he is a God-given right and any government that
considers   itself a democracy would naturally provide
its citizens with this
sort of access.  But what too many of this  Gap-wearing,
Real World-watching generation  fail to realize
is that our American
forefathers, under  the  tutelage of Zog, the wizened master sage from
Zeta-Reticuli, had to fight  not only   the godless and   effete British
for our system of  self-determined government, but also  avoid the  terrors
of hynpo-death  from the dark and
unclean Draco-Repitilians.</pre></blockquote>

<p>To prepare this text for printing, you'd like to
have all the lines be about 60 characters wide and remove the extra
space in the lines. Although you could format this text by hand, GNU
<i class="command">fmt</i> can do this for you with the following command
line:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% fmt -tuw 60 my_file</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="IXT-21-5649" />The <tt class="literal">-t</tt> option,
short for <tt class="literal">--tagged-paragraph</tt> mode, tells
<i class="command">fmt</i> to preserve the paragraph's
initial indent but align the rest of the lines with the left margin
of the second line. The <tt class="literal">-u</tt> option, short for
<tt class="literal">--uniform-spacing</tt>, squashes all the inappropriate
whitespace in the lines. The final option, <tt class="literal">-w</tt>,
sets the width of the output in characters. Like most UNIX commands,
<i class="command">fmt</i> sends its output to
<em class="emphasis">stdout</em>. For our test paragraph,
<i class="command">fmt</i> did this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">    Most people take their Emo Phillips for granted.
They figure, and not without some truth, that he is a
God-given right and any government that considers itself a
democracy would naturally provide its citizens with this
sort of access.  But what too many of this Gap-wearing,
Real World-watching generation fail to realize is that
our American forefathers, under the tutelage of Zog,
the wizened master sage from Zeta-Reticuli, had to fight
not only the godless and effete British for our system of
self-determined government, but also avoid the terrors of
hynpo-death from the dark and unclean Draco-Repitilians.</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="IXT-21-5650" />There is one
subtlety to <i class="command">fmt</i> to be aware of:
<i class="command">fmt</i> expects sentences to end with a period,
question mark, or exclamation point followed by two spaces. If your
document isn't marked up according to this
convention, <i class="command">fmt</i> can't
differentiate between sentences and abbreviations. This is a common
"gotcha" that appears frequently on
Usenet.
</p>
<a name="ch21-3-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>WARNING:</b> 
<a name="IXT-21-5651" />On at least one version of Unix,
<i class="command">fmt</i> is a disk initializer (disk formatter)
command. Don't run <em class="emphasis">that</em> command
accidentally! Check your online manual page and see the
<i class="command">fmt</i> equivalents that follow.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few different versions of <i class="command">fmt</i>, some
fancier than others. In general, the program assumes the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Paragraphs have blank lines between them.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If a line is indented, the indentation should be preserved.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The output lines should be about 70 characters wide. Some have a
command-line option to let you set this. For example, <tt class="literal">fmt
-132</tt> (or on some versions, <tt class="literal">fmt -l 132</tt>)
would reformat your file to have lines with no more than 132
characters on each.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It reads files or standard input. Lines will be written to standard
output.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><img src="figs/www.gif" alt="Figure " width="25" /> Go to <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3">http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: fmt</p>

<p><a name="IXT-21-5652" />The GNU
<i class="command">fmt</i> is on the CD-ROM [see <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3">http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a>]. There are also a couple of
free versions available. Many versions of <i class="command">fmt</i> have
options for other structured data. The <span class="option">-p</span><b class="emphasis-bold"> option</b> (<a href="ch21_04.htm#upt3-CHP-21-SECT-4">Section 21.4</a>)
reformats program source code. (If your <i class="command">fmt</i>
doesn't have <span class="option">-p</span>, the <b class="emphasis-bold">recomment</b> (<a href="ch21_04.htm#upt3-CHP-21-SECT-4">Section 21.4</a>)
script uses standard <i class="command">fmt</i> with
<i class="command">sed</i> to do the same thing.) The <span class="option">-s</span>
option breaks long lines at whitespace but doesn't
join short lines to form longer ones.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can <b class="emphasis-bold">make your own</b>
(<a href="ch21_03.htm#upt3-CHP-21-SECT-3">Section 21.3</a>) simple (and a little slower) version
with <i class="command">sed</i> and <i class="command">nroff</i>. If you want
to get fancy (and use some <i class="command">nroff</i> and/or
<i class="command">tbl</i> coding), this will let you do automatically
formatted text tables, bulleted lists, and much more.
