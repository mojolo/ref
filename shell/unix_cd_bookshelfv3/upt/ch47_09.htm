<h2 class="sect1">47.9. Citrix: Making Windows Multiuser</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-7652" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-7653" /> <a name="upt3-IDXTERM-7654" />Unix users needing
to access Windows applications will find that VNC is not a workable
solution in all instances. The reason for this is that Windows
operating systems were not designed to be multiuser; they do not
allow multiple concurrent user sessions. When you have more than a
few users needing to run a Windows application, such as Outlook to
connect to corporate email, your options are to put a Windows PC on
every desk, run Windows under a virtual machine, or set up Windows
Terminal Services (WTS).
</p>

<p>WTS is the current name of the multiuser software Microsoft provides
with the Windows 2000 Server product family. Its former iteration was
Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server. Similar to VNC, WTS provides a
Windows 2000 desktop to a connecting client, but does it in true
multiuser fashion. Dozens of users can be connected to the same
machine, running different processes, all independent of the other.
However, WTS is only part of the solution for Unix users. This is
because Microsoft only allows connections to a WTS server via the
<a name="IXT-47-2076" />Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) but
doesn't provide any non-Windows clients that use
RDP.
</p>

<p>On the flip side,
<a name="IXT-47-2077" />Citrix provides a
Unix client program that can connect to a WTS server, but it only
uses the Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol. For that
client to work, a server add-on product to WTS called
<a name="IXT-47-2078" /><a name="IXT-47-2079" />Citrix
Metaframe must be installed. Thankfully, Metaframe provides
additional features to a WTS server besides ICA connectivity that
helps to justify the additional cost.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-47-2080" /><a name="IXT-47-2081" />One
<a name="IXT-47-2082" />thing to be careful of when
implementing a WTS solution is licensing. Microsoft is very strict in
its rules about what machines can connect under which circumstances.
Like tollbooths on the highway, Microsoft wants to get paid no matter
how you get on, or which vehicle you're driving. To
put licensing simply, you must have a Windows 2000 Server license for
each server, a Windows 2000 Server Client Access License for each
machine connecting to the server, a Terminal Services License for
each machine actually using WTS, and, if you are using Office, each
machine that runs Office off the WTS server must have a license.
These are not concurrent licenses: if 50 machines are going to use
Office at some point, all 50 must have licenses, not just the 10 that
are connected at any given moment.
<a name="IXT-47-2083" />Citrix
licenses are in addition to Microsoft licenses but are thankfully
more friendly. Citrix allows the use of concurrent licenses, which
means 20 licenses could cover the needs of 50 users, if only 20 are
going to be connected at a time. Full details about Microsoft
licensing in a WTS environment can be found at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/howtobuy/pricing/tsfaq.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/howtobuy/pricing/tsfaq.asp</a>.

<h3 class="sect2">47.9.1. Citrix Metaframe</h3>

<p><a name="IXT-47-2084" /><a name="IXT-47-2085" />Assuming
that you have a properly installed and configured Citrix Metaframe
server to connect to, you should download and install the appropriate
<a name="IXT-47-2086" /><a name="IXT-47-2087" />ICA
client for your operating system from <a href="http://www.citrix.com/download/">http://www.citrix.com/download/</a>.
Installation is very simple and adequately explained in the provided
documentation.
</p>

<p>After installation, as a user, run
<i class="command">wfcmgr</i><a name="IXT-47-2088" /> from program directory you installed
to. This will launch the configuration program for the ICA client;
see <a href="ch47_09.htm#upt3-CHP-47-FIG-3">Figure 47-3</a>.
</p>

<a name="upt3-CHP-47-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/upt3_4703.gif" alt="Figure 47-3" width="450" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 47-3. Existing entries in wfcmgr</h4>

<p>To create a new entry, select New from the Entry menu. You will see
<a href="ch47_09.htm#upt3-CHP-47-FIG-4">Figure 47-4</a>. Though all settings are important, be
sure to adjust the settings pertaining to the Window properties. A
good tip is to set up your screen to be 90 percent of your display
size, to use a shared palette of colors, and to map drive letters to
your home directory, floppy, and CD-ROM. Using full-screen mode will
disable the use of multiple desktops on your Unix system, so it is
not a good idea. Using a shared palette prevents odd coloring on your
display. Mapping to your local devices is useful for transferring
files between the WTS server and your workstation. The settings to do
this are under the Option menu after you've saved
the entry.
</p>

<p>Running <i class="command">wfcmgr</i> also creates a
<em class="filename">.ICAClient</em> directory in the
user's home directory. Copy this directory to
<em class="filename">/etc/skel</em> to insure that new users are
automatically setup with default settings to access WTS. For existing
users, copy the directory to their home directory and give ownership
to that user.
</p>

<p>Create a symbolic link, such as
<em class="filename">/usr/local/bin/citrix</em>, in your default path that
points to <i class="command">wfcmgr</i>. Give it an easy name like
<em class="emphasis">citrix</em>. Using this link name, you can launch
saved configurations in <i class="command">wfcmgr</i> with a single
command.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ citrix <em class="replaceable"><tt>desc</em> <em class="replaceable">description_name</tt></em></pre></blockquote>

<p><em class="replaceable"><tt>description_name</tt></em>, in this instance, is the
descriptive name you gave your entry in <i class="command">wfcmgr</i>
(see <a href="ch47_09.htm#upt3-CHP-47-FIG-3">Figure 47-3</a>). It is case-sensitive.
</p>

<p>Metaframe offers many additional features, such as load balancing,
application publishing, automatic updates of ICA clients, and a
web-based client, that may help justify its cost. Citrix even sells a
Metaframe for Unix that provides Unix programs to Windows clients
that don't have an X Server.

<h3 class="sect2">47.9.2. rdesktop</h3>

<p>The fact that Microsoft has not provided an
<a name="IXT-47-2089" /><a name="IXT-47-2090" />RDP client for Unix has not stopped
enterprising programmers in the Open Source community from creating
one. This program, called
<i class="command">rdesktop</i><a name="IXT-47-2091" /><a name="IXT-47-2092" />, is available at <a href="http://www.rdesktop.org">http://www.rdesktop.org</a>. In everyday use this
program has proven to be as useful as the ICA client, though it lacks
support for sound, high color depths, drive mapping, or client-side
support for serial and parallel ports. If these features are
important to you, you will need Metaframe; if not, this free program
is an excellent alternative.

<h3 class="sect2">47.9.3. Hob</h3>

<p>Another RDP client, called <a name="IXT-47-2093" /><a name="IXT-47-2094" /><a name="IXT-47-2095" />HOBLink JWT, is available from
Hobsoft, <a href="http://www.hobsoft.com">http://www.hobsoft.com</a>.
The most interesting feature of this program is that it is written in
Java. This means that any client that has a browser with a working
Java runtime should be able to run this program. Hobsoft has provided
a lot of features in this product, and it is a viable alternative to
Citrix Metaframe.<a name="IXTR3-2099" /> <a name="IXTR3-2100" /> <a name="IXTR3-2101" />
