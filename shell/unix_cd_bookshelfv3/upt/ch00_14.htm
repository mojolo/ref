<h2 class="sect1">0.14. Acknowledgments for the Second Edition</h2>

<p>After teaching myself about Unix for the past 15 years, I'm off to
graduate school in Computer Science. Frank Willison, O'Reilly's
Editor-in-Chief, fit this project into the summer between leaving my
position at ORA and starting school. Frank didn't just give me
something to do in the summer: the royalties should help to pay for
my coursework. (So, buy this book and support a student!
<tt class="literal">;-)</tt>) Gigi Estabrook edited this edition and
fielded my zillions of questions along the way. Many thanks to Gigi,
Frank, and ORA's Production staff. Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary and
Nancy Wolfe Kotary shared the jobs of production editor and project
manager. Madeleine Newell and Kismet McDonough-Chan provided
production support. Sheryl Avruch, Nicole Gipson Arigo, and Danny
Marcus provided quality control checks. Lenny Muellner provided
extensive <em class="emphasis">troff</em> assistance and technical
support. Chris Reilley created the technical illustrations.
</p>

<p>When time was short, I got expert advice from Arnold Robbins, the
maintainer of the GNU <em class="emphasis">gawk</em> utility, and coauthor
of O'Reilly's <em class="emphasis">sed &amp; awk</em>, Second Edition. He
reviewed parts of the book and gave me thorough comments.
</p>

<p>I'd also like to thank all the readers who took a moment to send us
comments and corrections. I read every message, and the ideas in them
made a big difference in this second edition. Three peoples' comments
were extensive enough to mention specially. Ted Timar spotted
problems that showed his deep knowledge of Unix. I'm glad he still
found the book useful enough to read it -- and to spot goofs in
some of our hairier tips. Andrew T. Young sent two long email
messages: one a few years ago and another after I contacted him. He
caught plenty of techno-goofs and also sent fixes for them. Andy
doesn't know just Unix: his background in English helped to sharpen a
few rough spots in our folksy writing style. Finally, Greg Ubben sent
a 15-page (!) email message that took me most of a week to work
through. When I tracked him down, three years after writing his
message, he was even more helpful. Greg wrote enough to make into a
small book -- and, in fact, agreed to write a few new articles,
too. He's an expert in <em class="emphasis">sed</em> and regular
expressions (and Unix) who taught me a lot in our month of email
messages back and forth. I deeply appreciate all that he's given to
this book's readers.
</p>
