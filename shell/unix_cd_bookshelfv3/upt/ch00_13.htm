<h2 class="sect1">0.13. Acknowledgments for the First Edition</h2>

<p>This book wouldn't exist without Ron Petrusha. As the technical book
buyer at Golden-Lee, a major book distributor, he discovered us soon
after we started publishing Nutshell Handbooks in the mid-1980s. He
was one of our early boosters, and we owed him one. So when he became
an editor at Bantam (whose computer-book publishing operations were
later acquired by Random House), we took him seriously when he
started asking if there was anything we could do together.
</p>

<p>At first nothing seemed to fit, since by that time we were doing
pretty well as a publisher. We needed to find something that we could
do together that might sell better than something that either company
might do alone. Eventually, Ron suggested that we copublish a Unix
book for Bantam's "Power Tools"
series. This made sense for both of us. It gave Bantam access to our
Unix expertise and reputation, and it gave us a chance to learn from
Bantam about the mass market bookstore trade, as well as build on
their successful "Power Tools"
series.
</p>

<p>But what would the book contain? There were two features of Bantam's
original <em class="emphasis">DOS Power Tools</em> that we decided to
emulate: its in-depth treatment of under-documented system features
and its large collection of freely available scripts and utilities.
However, we didn't want to write yet another book that duplicated the
format of many others on the market, in which chapters on each of the
major Unix tools follow one another in predictable succession. Our
goal was certainly to provide essential technical information on Unix
utilities, but more importantly, to show how the utilities can be
combined and used to solve common (and uncommon) problems.
</p>

<p>Similarly, because we were weary of the multitude of endless tutorial
books about Unix utilities, we wanted to keep the tone brisk and to
the point. The solution I came up with, a kind of
"hypertext in print," actually owes
a lot to Dale Dougherty. Dale has been working for several years on
hypertext and online information delivery, and I was trying to get
him to work with me on this project. So I tried to imagine the kind
of book that he might like to create. (We have a kind of friendly
rivalry, in which we try to leapfrog each other with ideas for new
and better books!) Dale's involvement never went far beyond the early
brainstorming stage, but the book still bears his indirect stamp. In
some of the first books he wrote for me, he introduced the idea that
sidebars -- asides that illuminate and expand on the topic under
discussion -- could be used effectively in a technical book. Well,
Dale, here's a book that's nothing but sidebars!
</p>

<p>Dale, Mike Loukides, and I worked out the basic outline for the book
in a week or two of brainstorming and mail exchanges. We thought we
could throw it together pretty quickly by mining many of our existing
books for the tips and tricks buried in them. Unfortunately, none of
us was ever able to find enough time, and the book looked to be dying
a slow death. (Mike was the only one who got any writing done.) Steve
Talbott rescued the project by insisting that it was just too good an
idea to let go; he recruited Jerry Peek, who had just joined the
company as a writer and Unix consultant/tools developer for our
production department.
</p>

<p>Production lost the resulting tug of war, and Jerry plunged in. Jerry
has forgotten more Unix tips and tricks than Mike, Dale, or I ever
knew; he fleshed out our outline and spent a solid year writing and
collecting the bulk of the book. I sat back in amazement and delight
as Jerry made my ideas take shape. Finally, though, Jerry had had
enough. The book was just too big, and he'd never signed on to do it
all alone! (It was about 1,000 pages at that point, and only half
done.) Jerry, Mike, and I spent a week locked up in our conference
room, refining the outline, writing and cutting articles, and
generally trying to make Jerry feel a little less like Sisyphus.
</p>

<p>From that point on, Jerry continued to carry the ball, but not quite
alone, with Mike and I playing "tag
team," writing and editing to fill in gaps. I'm
especially grateful to Mike for pitching in, since he had many other
books to edit and this was supposed to be
"my" project. I am continually
amazed by the breadth of Mike's knowledge and his knack for putting
important concepts in perspective.
</p>

<p>Toward the end of the project, Linda Mui finished up another book she
was working on and joined the project, documenting many of the freely
available utilities that we'd planned to include but hadn't gotten
around to writing up. Linda, you really saved us at the end!
</p>

<p>Thanks also to all the other authors, who allowed us to use (and
sometimes abuse!) their material. In particular, we're grateful to
Bruce Barnett, who let us use so much of what he's written, even
though we haven't yet published his book, and Chris Torek, who let us
use many of the gems he's posted to the Net over the years. (Chris
didn't keep copies of most of these articles; they were saved and
sent in by Usenet readers, including Dan Duval, Kurt J. Lidl, and
Jarkko Hietaniemi.)
</p>

<p>Jonathan Kamens and Tom Christiansen not only contributed articles
but read parts of the book with learned and critical eyes. They saved
us from many a "power goof." If
we'd been able to give them enough time to read the whole thing, we
wouldn't have to issue the standard disclaimer that any errors that
remain are our own. H. Milton Peek provided technical review and
proofreading. Four sharp-eyed Usenet readers helped with debugging:
Casper Dik of the University of Amsterdam, Byron Ratzikis of Network
Appliance Corporation, Dave Barr of the Population Research
Institute, and Duncan Sinclair.
</p>

<p>In addition to all the acknowledged contributors, there are many
unacknowledged ones -- people who have posted questions or answers
to the Net over the years and who have helped to build the rich
texture of the Unix culture that we've tried to reflect in this book.
Jerry also singles out one major contributor to his own mastery of
Unix. He says: "Daniel Romike of Tektronix, Inc.
(who wrote <a href="ch28_05.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-5">Section 28.5</a> and <a href="ch30_08.htm#upt3-CHP-30-SECT-8">Section 30.8</a> in the early 1980s, by the way) led the first
Unix workshop I attended. He took the time to answer a ton of
questions as I taught myself Unix in the early 1980s. I'm sure some
of the insights and neat tricks that I thought I've figured out
myself actually came from Dan instead."
</p>

<p>James Revell and Bryan Buus scoured "the
Net" for useful and interesting free software that
we weren't aware of. Bryan also compiled most of the software he
collected so we could try it out and gradually winnow down the list.
</p>

<p>Thanks also to all of the authors of the software packages we wrote
about and included on the CD! Without their efforts, we wouldn't have
had anything to write about; without their generosity in making their
software free in the first place, we wouldn't be able to distribute
hundreds of megabytes of software for the price of a book.
</p>

<p>Jeff Moskow of Ready-to-Run Software solved the problem we had been
putting off to the end: that of packaging up all the software for the
original disk, porting it to the major Unix platforms, and making it
easy to install. This was a much bigger job than we'd anticipated,
and we could never have done it without Jeff and the RTR staff. We
might have been able to distribute source code and binaries for a few
platforms, but without their porting expertise, we could never have
ported all these programs to every supported platform. Eric Pearce
worked with RTR to pre-master the software for CD-ROM duplication,
wrote the installation instructions, and made sure that everything
came together at the end! (Eric, thanks for pitching in at the last
minute. You were right that there were a lot of details that might
fall through the cracks.)
</p>

<p>Edie Freedman worked with us to design the format of the
book -- quite an achievement considering everything we wanted the
format to do! She met the challenge of presenting thousands of inline
cross-references without distracting the reader or creating a visual
monstrosity. What she created is as attractive as it is
useful -- a real breakthrough in technical book design, and one
that we plan to use again and again!
</p>

<p>Lenny Muellner was given the frightful task of implementing all of
our ideas in <em class="emphasis">troff</em> -- no mean feat, and one
that added to his store of grey hair.
</p>

<p>Eileen Kramer was the copyeditor, proofreader, and critic who made
sure that everything came together. For a thousand-plus page book
with multiple authors, it's hard to imagine just how much work that
was.
</p>

<p>Ellie Cutler wrote the index; Chris Reilley created the
illustrations. Additional administrative support was provided by
Bonnie Hyland, Donna Woonteiler, and Jane Appleyard.
