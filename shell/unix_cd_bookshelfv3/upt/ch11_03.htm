<h2 class="sect1">11.3. Context diffs</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1819" />
<a name="upt3-IDXTERM-1820" />The <i class="command">diff</i> examples in
<a href="ch11_01.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 11.1</a> and <a href="ch11_02.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-2">Section 11.2</a> show compact formats with just the differences
between the two files. But, in many cases, context
<i class="command">diff</i> listings are more useful. Context
<i class="command">diff</i>s show the changed lines and the lines around
them. (This can be a headache if you're trying to
read the listing on a terminal and there are many changed lines
fairly close to one another: the context will make a huge
"before" section, with the
"after" section several screenfuls
ahead. In that case, the more compact <i class="command">diff</i> formats
can be useful.) A related format, unified <i class="command">diff</i>,
shows context but doesn't take as much space.
</p>

<p><img src="figs/www.gif" alt="Figure " width="25" /> Go to <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3">http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: rcs</p>

<p>The <i class="command">rcsdiff</i><a name="IXT-11-6063" /> command shows differences between
revisions in an <b class="emphasis-bold">RCS</b> (<a href="ch39_05.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-5">Section 39.5</a>) file (and will only be available if you have
RCS installed). We'll use it here instead of
<i class="command">diff</i> -- but the concepts are the same.
Incidentally, these examples would also work with <b class="emphasis-bold">cvs diff</b> (<a name="IXT-11-6064" /><a href="ch39_07.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-7">Section 39.7</a>), if you
have CVS installed.
</p>

<p>The <span class="option">-c</span> option shows before-and-after versions of
each changed section of a file. By itself, <span class="option">-c</span> shows
three lines above and below each change. Here's an
example of a C file before and after some edits; the
<tt class="literal">-c2</tt> option shows two lines of context. The
<span class="option">-u</span> option shows changed lines next to each other,
not in separate before-and-after sections. Again, an option like
<tt class="literal">-u2</tt> shows two lines of context around a change
instead of the default three lines.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Start of a listing</i></dt>
<dd>
A <em class="emphasis">diff -c</em></tt><a name="IXT-11-6065" /><a name="IXT-11-6066" /> listing starts with the two
filenames and their last-modified dates
("timestamps"). The first filename
(here, <em class="emphasis">atcat.c</em></tt> revision 1.1) has three asterisks
(<tt class="literal">***</tt>) before it; the second name
(<em class="emphasis">atcat.c</em></tt> revision 1.2) has three dashes
(<tt class="literal">---</tt>). These markers identify the two files in the
difference listings below:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">*** atcat.c 1987/09/19 12:00:44 1.1
--- atcat.c 1987/09/19 12:08:41 1.2</pre></blockquote>

<p>A <em class="emphasis">diff -u</em></tt><a name="IXT-11-6067" />
listing also starts with the two filenames and their last-modified
dates ("timestamps"). The first
filename (here, <em class="emphasis">atcat.c</em></tt> revision 1.1) has three
minus signs (<tt class="literal">---</tt>) before it, meaning
"from" or
"before." The second name
(<em class="emphasis">atcat.c</em></tt> revision 1.2) has three plus signs
(<tt class="literal">+++</tt>). Again, these markers identify the two files
in the difference listings that follow:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">--- atcat.c 1987/09/19 12:00:44 1.1
+++ atcat.c 1987/09/19 12:08:41 1.2</pre></blockquote>
</dd>


<dt><i>Start of a section</i></dt>
<dd>
Each difference section in a <em class="emphasis">diff
-c</em><a name="IXT-11-6068" /> listing starts with a row of asterisks:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">***************</pre></blockquote>
<p>In a <em class="emphasis">diff -u</em><a name="IXT-11-6069" /> listing, each difference section starts
with a line that has a pair of line numbers and line counts. This one
means that the first version of the file (with a <tt class="literal">-</tt>
before it) starts at line 14 and contains 5 lines; the second version
of the file (with a <tt class="literal">+</tt>) also starts at line 14 and
has 5 lines:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">@@ -14,5 +14,5 @@</pre></blockquote>
</dd>


<dt><i>Changes</i></dt>
<dd>
In a <em class="emphasis">diff -c</em></tt><a name="IXT-11-6070" /> listing, changed lines that exist in both
files are marked with an <tt class="literal">!</tt> (exclamation point)
character in the left margin. So, one of the lines between lines
15-19 was changed. Other lines in the section
weren't changed:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">*** 15, 19 ****

  static char rcsid[ ] =

  #endif not lint
  /* end of Identification */</pre></blockquote>

<p>A <em class="emphasis">diff -u</em></tt><a name="IXT-11-6071" /> listing always shows lines that are marked
with a minus (<tt class="literal">-</tt>) only in the first version and
lines marked with a plus (<tt class="literal">+)</tt> in the second
version. Here, one line was changed:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">@@ -15,5 +15,5 @@

 /* end of Identification */</pre></blockquote>

</dd>


<dt><i>Deletions</i></dt>
<dd>
In a <em class="emphasis">diff -c</em><a name="IXT-11-6072" /> listing, a line that exists in the first
version but not the second version is marked with a minus sign
(<tt class="literal">-</tt>). None of the lines from the second version are
shown. So, line 62 in the first version (lines 64-68) was deleted,
leaving lines 64-67 in the second version:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">*** 64,68 ****
  {
    int i;              /* for loop index */
-   int userid;         /* uid of owner of file */
    int isuname;        /* is a command line argv a user name? */
    int numjobs;        /* # of jobs in spooling area */
--- 64,67 ----</pre></blockquote>

<p>A <em class="emphasis">diff -u</em><a name="IXT-11-6073" /> listing simply shows the deleted line with
a minus (<tt class="literal">-</tt>) sign before it. The section started at
line 64 and had 5 lines; after the change, it starts at line 64 and
has 4 lines:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">@@ -64,5 +64,4 @@

    int numjobs;        /* # of jobs in spooling area */</pre></blockquote>
</dd>



<dt><i>Additions</i></dt>
<dd>
In a <em class="emphasis">diff -c</em></tt><a name="IXT-11-6074" /> listing, lines that are
added are marked with an exclamation point (!) and only appear in the
second version. So, one of the lines between lines 111-116 was
changed, and two other lines were added, leaving lines 111-118 in the
second version:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">*** 111,116 ****
     * are given, print usage info and exit.
     */
!   if (allflag &amp;&amp; argc)
        usage( );

    /*
--- 111,118 ----
     * are given, print usage info and exit.
     */
!   if (allflag &amp;&amp; argc) {
        usage( );
+       exit(1);
+   }

    /*</pre></blockquote>


<p>In a <em class="emphasis">diff -u</em></tt><a name="IXT-11-6075" /> listing, lines that are only
in the second version are always marked with a <tt class="literal">+</tt>.
Here, one line was changed, and two lines were added. The original
version started at line 111 and had 6 lines; the changed version
started at line 111 and has 8 lines:
</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">@@ -111,6 +111,8 @@

-   if (allflag &amp;&amp; argc)

<p><a name="IXT-11-6076" />Context <i class="command">diff</i>s
aren't just nice for reading. The <b class="emphasis-bold">patch</b> (<a href="ch20_09.htm#upt3-CHP-20-SECT-9">Section 20.9</a>) program
reads context <i class="command">diff</i> listings and uses them to
update files automatically. For example, if I had the first version
of <em class="emphasis">atcat.c</em></tt>, someone could send me either of the
previous <i class="command">diff</i> listings (called a
"patch"). From the original and the
patch, <i class="command">patch</i> could create the second version of
<em class="emphasis">atcat.c</em></tt>. The advantage of a context
<i class="command">diff</i> over the formats in <a href="ch11_01.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 11.1</a> and <a href="ch11_02.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-2">Section 11.2</a> is that
context <i class="command">diff</i>s let <i class="command">patch</i> locate
the changed sections even if they've been moved
somewhat. In this case, it's probably
<em class="emphasis">not</em></tt> a good idea to save space by reducing the
number of context lines (with <tt class="literal">-c2</tt> or
<tt class="literal">-u2</tt>, as I did here); giving all three lines of
context can help <i class="command">patch</i> locate the changed
sections.
