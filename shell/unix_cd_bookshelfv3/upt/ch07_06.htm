<h2 class="sect1">7.6. Naming Files</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-7-6948" /><a name="IXT-7-6949" /><a name="IXT-7-6950" />Let's
think about a filing cabinet again. If the files in your filing
cabinet were called <em class="filename">letter1</em>,
<em class="filename">letter2</em>, <em class="filename">letter3</em>, and so
on, you'd never be able to find anything -- the
names aren't descriptive enough. The same is true on
your computer -- you should come up with a descriptive name for
each file that you create. Unix systems let you have very long
filenames. A few older systems have a 14-character limit, but most
allow names that are 256 characters long -- hopefully, longer than
you will ever need.
</p>

<p>Generally, a descriptive filename summarizes the contents with a few
useful words. <em class="filename">letter</em> is not a terribly useful
summary, unless perhaps you've only ever written one
letter and don't expect to write another. The
recipient's name (<em class="filename">JohnShmoe</em>,
for example) would only be a useful summary if you expect to send
only one letter to that person. Even if you only plan to send one
letter, the name doesn't tell you anything about
what you sent Mr. Shmoe.
</p>

<p><em class="filename">OctoberGoldPriceTrends</em> is a pretty good summary;
it's obvious what the contents of that file are,
though you might want to know to which year it referred, looking back
two years from now. I often start time-specific files with the date,
so that <em class="filename">ls</em> sorts the files in date order. If you
do this, I recommend a <em class="filename">YYYYMMDD</em> format to get
proper sorting, so files look like
<em class="filename">20021004-GoldPrices</em>. If you're
going to have regular updates to something, you might want to make a
directory to hold those things (e.g.,
<em class="filename">GoldPrices/20021004</em>,
<em class="filename">GoldPrices/20021108</em>,
<em class="filename">GoldPrices/20021206,</em> and so forth). Note that in
this specific example, a filename of nothing but a date makes sense,
because you don't have anything else in that
directory but information on gold prices.
</p>

<p>Bruce Barnett has suggested that, by using long filenames, you can
create a simple "relational
database." For example, you could find out
everything you've recorded about the price of gold
with a command like <em class="filename">more *Gold*Price*</em>. Of
course, if this starts to get very complex, using an actual database
is much simpler.
</p>

<p>Similarly, if you're a programmer, the name of each
file in your program should describe what the code does. If the code
diagonalizes matrices, the file should be called something like
<em class="filename">MatrixDiagonalizer.cpp</em>. If the code reads input
from bank tellers, it should be called something like
<em class="filename">teller_input.c</em>. Some programming languages even
enforce this by requiring a particular file-naming convention; Java
requires files to have only one object per file, and the name of the
file and the object within it must be the same. (Of course, if your
object names aren't very good,
you're right back where you started.)
