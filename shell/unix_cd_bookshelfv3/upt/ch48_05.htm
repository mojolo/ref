<h2 class="sect1">48.5. What We Mean by DoS</h2>

<p>Another major security problem is one in which users of a Unix system
can't access the functionality because access
attempts are being blocked in some way. These blocking efforts are
called, appropriately enough, <a name="IXT-48-1903" />denial-of-service attacks, usually
abbreviated <a name="IXT-48-1904" />DoS.
</p>

<p>CERT defines three types of <a name="IXT-48-1905" />DoS attacks:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>An attack that consumes all resources</p>
</li><li>
<p>Manipulation of configuration information</p>
</li><li>
<p>Manipulation of network components</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Resources in a networked system include memory, bandwidth, Internet
connections, and so on. In a DoS attack, the attacker seeks to use
these resources in such a way that no one else can connect to the
system. Famous examples of this type of attack involve a concept
known as the <a name="IXT-48-1906" /> <a name="IXT-48-1907" />distributed denial-of-service attack,
DDoS.
</p>

<p>In a DDoS attack, several machines that have not been properly
secured against external control are compromised, and an application
is placed on each. This application lies dormant until triggered by
the attacker. When this happens, these compromised
machines -- known as <em class="emphasis">handlers</em> -- direct
other compromised machines -- known as
<em class="emphasis">agents</em><a name="IXT-48-1908" /><a name="IXT-48-1909" /> -- to run an application that
generates network packets, all of which are directed to a specific
target. These packets overwhelm the available bandwidth of the
victim, and they may also overwhelm routers in the path to the victim
to the point where entire sections of the Internet may be negatively
impacted.
</p>

<p>Though Windows-based rather than Unix, the Code Red worm that caused
so many problems in 2001 was based on the premise of DDoS.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-48-1910" />Though disabling, DoS attacks
based on overutilizing ephemeral resources such as bandwidth deny
access but don't permanently damage a
machine's infrastructure. However, another DoS
attack is one in which an attacker gains root access to a machine and
modifies <a name="IXT-48-1911" />configuration information such as
usernames and passwords, in such a way that no one can access the
network.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-48-1912" />How simple is it to access
configuration information? Accessing the password file on a system
can be as easy as using <a name="IXT-48-1913" />TFTP (Trivial File Transfer
Protocol) to download the password file unless TFTP is disabled or
configured to prevent unauthorized access.
</p>

<p>In fact, a DDoS attack is dependent on the attacker getting access to
several machines in order to launch an attack. Keeping your system
clean and protected not only prevents invasion of your own systems,
but prevents your Unix boxes from being used to launch attacks on
others.
</p>

<p>The third type of <a name="IXT-48-1914" />DoS attack is based on physical
attack. Literally, if someone comes after your wires with an axe, no
security software is going to protect your system. However,
axe-wielding intruders are beyond the scope of this book, so
we'll concentrate primarily on software and system
adjustments to protect against DoS attacks.
