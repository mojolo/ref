<h2 class="sect1"><a name="sect1" />48.1. Understanding Points of Vulnerability</h2>

<p><a name="upt3-IDXTERM-7679" />Rather
<a name="IXT-48-1880" /><a name="IXT-48-1881" />than being
impregnable fortresses of steel, most computers are about as leaky as
old wooden fishing boats. Though the press has focused primarily on
Windows security violations in the last few years, Unix boxes are
just as vulnerable and require as much, or more, effort to keep safe.
</p>

<p>If your Unix box sits in your home, it is protected from unauthorized
access, you live alone, and you never connect to the Internet,
security probably isn't a concern for you. However,
chances are your Unix box is fairly easy to access physically, and
your system is most likely connected to the Internet through a modem
or other network connection. In both these cases, this chapter and
those that follow are of extreme interest to you.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-48-1882" />Anytime
you have a multiuser system, your account is vulnerable to others in
the system and to anyone who might break into the system from outside
your organization. The only way to protect accounts is to ensure that
good account management practices are in place, such as removing
accounts when people are no longer with the organization and using
difficult-to-hack passwords, as well as making sure that sensitive
data is protected by accidental or deliberate access.
</p>

<p>For single-user systems, you'll want to make sure
that someone can't accidentally or deliberately log
into your machine at home or work. Chances are no one would try, but
particularly if you have something such as Linux installed on a
laptop, you're going to want to keep the snoops out.
</p>

<p><a name="IXT-48-1883" />More importantly, before you
connect to the Internet, you have to know what
you're doing with your system, particularly if you
run applications such as web servers on your system. All you need is
one harmful worm or virus, or to have a cracker break into your
system, to have all your work and effort compromised.
</p>

<p>The above areas of vulnerability -- account, machine, and
system -- probably don't surprise you. But are
you aware that you're vulnerable to yourself?
</p>

<p>How many times have you accidentally deleted a file? Now, how many
times have you deleted a file and not had backup in place? Security
isn't just a protection against external intrusion.
Used effectively, security is also an effective means to protect the
system and the data and applications from internal error and blunder.
</p>

<p>Before you install your Unix operating system and turn on your
machine, you need to have a security plan in place, starting with a
<b class="emphasis-bold">security checklist</b> (<a href="ch48_02.htm#upt3-CHP-48-SECT-2">Section 48.2</a>).
