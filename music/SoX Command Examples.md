Install

 $ sudo apt-get install sox

Convert FLAC files from 24/48 bit to 16 bit

```
$ mkdir resampled
$ for flac in *.flac; do sox -S "${flac}" -r 44100 -b 16 ./resampled/"${flac}"; done
```

Convert 24-bit/96kHz audio to 16-bit/44.1kHz

Sox automatically dithers when it is appropriate to do so.

sox input.wav -b 16 -r 44.1k output.wav

sox input.wav -b 16 -r 44.1k **dither** output.wav

Convert 24-bit/96kHz audio to 16-bit/44.1kHz with shibata noise-shaping algorithm.

unless you're 100% sure that you need to use a specific algorithm for  the type of audio you have, just let SoX 'do the right thing' per your  command above.

sox input.wav -b 16 -r 44.1k output.wav dither -f shibata

Convert & dither without unnecessarily adding dither noise on silence

sox input.wav -b 16 -r 44.1k output.wav dither -a -f shibata

Clipping

As suggested by the tool, try reducing the volume slightly, e.g. by  preceding  with -v 0.99 (or 0.98 etc.).  Such small changes in volume  are imperceptible.  

Example:

```
sox -v 0.99 <source_wav> -b 16 <dest_wav> channels 1 rate 16000 trim <startTime> =<endTime>
```

If you still get clipping then the audio is likely severely clipped  (i.e. disorted) to begin with (this is common with modern music; see  Wikipedia: [Loudness war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war)) and so the warnings can be ignoredâ€”no additional distortion is being introduced.

As mentioned in the comments, the -G option can be given which will  automatically make any adjustment to the volume needed to avoid clipping (at the expense of a little extra CPU time, i.e. it runs slightly  slower with -G).

it doesn't decrease the volume automatically as this takes a little  longer and is not always what you want to do. It can be enabled though  with the -G (guard) option; with -V it will tell you how many dBs of  attenuation had to be applied to prevent clipping (dB "not reclaimed").

### Remove Pre-Emphasis

- Use 32-bit bit depth & floating point (benefits from clipping protection & preserving low-level details)
- increase gain if there is any decent amount of headroom left after the de-emphasis
- Convert to 16-bit with dithering

```
$ mkdir deemph
$ for flac in *.flac; do sox -S "${flac}" -b 32 ./deemph/"${flac}.wav" deemph; done
$ cd deemph
$ mkdir resampled
$ for wav in *.wav; do sox -S "${wav}" -b 16 ./resampled/"${wav}.flac"; done
```
